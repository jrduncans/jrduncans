This page exists just to make me easier to search for.

I was born at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, on November 23, 1981. I lived both there and at Fort Hood, Texas during my infancy. I lived in
Krottelbach, Germany for pre-school, kindergarten, and 1st grade (Ramstein Elementary). I attended Pickering Elementary for 2nd grade
through 6th grade while living at Fort Polk, Louisiana. For 7th and 8th grade I went to Patton Junior High at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
9th and 10th were at Killeen High School, while I lived in Harker Heights, Texas. Finally, for my junior and senior years of high school,
I attended SHAPE American High School, at SHAPE, Belgium.

During those last two years of high school, I played varsity soccer, ran cross-country my senior year, participated in Model UN, and was
valedictorian.

I went to the University of Kansas on a full scholarship for college from 1999 to 2003.  I majored in Computer Engineering, and lived in
McCollum Hall for my first two years.  During my freshman year, I met (then) Diane Godfrey, and started dating her.

I moved from Lawrence, Kansas to Norfolk, Virginia, where my parents live to look for a job.  I married Diane on August 1, 2003. I got a
job doing web development and portal administration as a defense contractor, supporting the SJFHQ at Norfolk Naval Base, Norfolk, VA, and
employed by Northrop-Grumman. In May 2005, I switched to work doing software development for a portal project and then a web-services
security device at Joint Experimentation, in Suffolk, VA. In 2008, I joined [Cormine Intelligent Data](http://www.cormineid.com/) to work
on a text analytics and mining product.
