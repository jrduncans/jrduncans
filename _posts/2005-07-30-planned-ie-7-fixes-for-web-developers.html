<p>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/07/29/445242.aspx">Standards and CSS planned for IE7</a>.  It's great to hear about all the fixes they plant to implement.  I think it's great that they used <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/">PositionIsEverything</a> and <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/">QuirksMode</a> to develop their list.  For anybody who has had to implement hack to deal with Internet Explorer in a website design, go over there, check if the problem is on the list to be fixed, and if not, post a comment on what you'd like to see.
