<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com">Scoble</a> asks <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/02/08/why-dont-you-use-a-memetracker/">Why don't you use a memetracker?</a>.  Check out the comments, as I agree with most of the answers.  Summary: not enough new stuff, not a useful format, and, finally, why would I?
</p>
<p>
What would a useful "Memetracker" look like?  First, it will have to integrate with my feed-reader/aggregator (do we have a single agreed upon name for this yet?) data.   That way you can exclude the stuff I already know about.  Plus you could tailor it to be interesting to me. <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> could pull this off, as could any other aggregator that centrally stores feed-reading data.  Or, if <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/attentionxml">attention</a> or some other feed-reading-data-sharing mechanism were available, it could be done by a third party.
</p>
<p>
Second, it would be provided primarily as another feed.  Not having to go out to another website and hitting refresh over-and-over is exactly the reason we love RSS and Atom so much.
</p>
<p>
So, what I'd want is an Atom feed of new items that I have neither read yet, nor have I read anything that linked to it yet.  I want to see a summary of the main content, and possibly some links to the most interesting commentary on the item.  An algorithm to determine <a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/">interestingness</a> like <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> does would be the killer feature.  A combination of popularity and making sure it includes some significant commentary instead of just being a another quote-and-link would be a good starting point.  And, of course, I want "interestingness" to be somewhat based on what I already read, so that I can get more Java and less Microsoft, more economics and constitutional law and less party politics, and soccer and basketball, instead of just technology and politics.
