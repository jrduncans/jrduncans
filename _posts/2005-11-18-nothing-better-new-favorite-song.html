<p>
<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/postalservice/nothingbetter.html">Nothing Better</a>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Postal_Service">The Postal Service</a>, is my new current favorite song.  It's a great back-and-forth-between-a-boy-and-a-girl duet.  My favorite part is this rebuttal by the girl:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I feel I must interject here
You're getting carried away 
Feeling sorry for yourself
With these revisions
And gaps in history
</p>
<p>
So let me help you remember.
I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear
I've prepared a lecture
On why I have to leave
</p>
</blockquote>
