<p>
I've hacked together a <a class="internal" href="{% link firefoxthemes.html %}">theme</a>.  Basically, I just put <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/4266778/">Noia 2.0 eXtreme's</a> tabs and scrollbars onto the default theme.  I've gone through a few iterations, and am pretty happy with the decision not to style the tab bar, but just the tabs.
</p>
<p>
What I don't have is any artistic talent myself.  For now, the icon for this theme is simply a cropped piece of a selected tab.  The preview is  a screen shot of the theme.  Both of these could use some work to fit with what most themes do.  Anybody want to help?
