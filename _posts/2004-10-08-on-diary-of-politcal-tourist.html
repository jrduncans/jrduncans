<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/seipp/seipp200410070833.asp">National Review article on Alexandra Pelosi's "Diary of a Political Tourist"</a>.  Interesting stuff on the personality of some of the democratic candidates from a documentary done during the primaries.

<blockquote>
<p>
So why does she think Kerry became the Democratic nominee? "He had the most stamina and he was the most politically savvy, and I think he had the best organization," Pelosi said. Or at least, that was as good a reason as she could offer. In the end, Kerry remains as much an enigma to her as he does to voters.

"The truth is," she says at the end of Diary, "after a year on the road, I know why the other guys lost. But I still don't know why John Kerry was the winner."
