<p>
Just got back from watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/combined">Serenity</a>.  It was excellent: go see it if you haven't.  It helps if you've watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/combined">Firefly</a>, as the movie can't possibly give you the depth of the characters like the TV show.  But it's not necessary.  Just watch it for a great story, wonderfull, funny dialog, and good action.
