<p>
<a href="http://www.curiouskitten.net">CuriousKitten.net</a> has a new site design.  It may look suspiciously familiar.  Permalink pages aren't styled because it's creating them as .htm files, not .shtml, so the included page for the header that defines the style-sheets isn't being included.  This isn't a problem on my blog, but I can't find the option that changes this in <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>.  Is this an option that was removed (but saved for those of us who set it when the option was available)?
