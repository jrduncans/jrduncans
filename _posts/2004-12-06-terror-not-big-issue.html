<p>
<a href="http://www.ofbyandfor.org/node/view/985">War on Terror not Global Issue</a> - Mitch Kapor links to a NYT article stating that the War on Terror is not the most pressing issue in the world to most people outside America.  Is the result of, or the cause of, America being the leader and primary participant in said War on Terror?
