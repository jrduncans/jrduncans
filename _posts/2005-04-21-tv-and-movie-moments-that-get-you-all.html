Now, I've never cried during a movie.  Anyone who knows me would say that I'm not all that emotional of a guy.  But there were two video-moments that I recently watched that did choke me up a bit.  Both these scenes were both extremely well acted, in addition to be about quite difficult, emotional issues.
</p>
<p>
The first comes from an unexpected source: a sitcom.  <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/GuidePageServlet/showid-161/epid-15992/">Mother Wore Stripes</a>, from that tremendous comedy, <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/Wings/index.html">Wings</a>.  Joe, played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004857">Timothy Daly</a>, confronts his mother, who abondened him and his family when was young (pre-teen?), and left him to take care of his of father (who was crazy), and his younger brother.  The combination of Joe's anger, his expression of all the things he's lost, and how his life and who he is was changed by her decision to leave, as well as Daly's perfect acting make this an extremely potent scene.  Daly's voice control is what really carries this scene.

The second moment comes from a more expected place: a classic movie.  This time the incredible acting comes from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000007/">Bogie</a>, in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046816/">The Caine Mutiny</a>.  When Bogart's character, Lt. Cmdr. Queeg, breaks down and shows his insanity during his cross-examination for the mutiny trial.  Here it's Bogart's facial expressions that make you feel an immediate, overwhelming pity for the character.

So, do you have any movie or tv moments that you found particuarly powerful?  Ones that choked you up, or made you cry (that is, if you're not the sort that cries at everything...)?
