<p>
I know by this point, everybody who wanted one has one, and I don't even use mine anymore (I don't email that much, to be honest), but I apparently have 5 G-mail invites available, so if you want one, <a href="mailto:stephen.duncan@gmail.com">e-mail me</a>.  Preference will be given to e-mails from .mil addresses.
