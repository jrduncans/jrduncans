The San Antonio Spurs blew a good chance to win the Championship.  They had it close must of the game, but couldn't quite make it happen.  It was a tough game.  The Pistons, especially Billups and Hamilton, hit a lot of very well-defended shots, while the Spurs, especially Barry and Ginobili, missed several wide open three point shots.  But, in the end, the problem is the same as it has been all series and for the last several years: turnovers.  The Spurs had 11 while the Pistons had only 5.  Tony Parker had 4 and Manu Ginobili had 3.  You just can't have your primary ball-handling guards turn the ball over that much.  Several of the turnovers were unforced errors.  If the Spurs can change that, then they will win Game 7.  If not, then Detroit deserves to win the NBA Championship: execution at the highest level is what it's all about.

Rasheed Wallace made a lot of the big plays down the stretch for Detroit.  He did it with 5 fouls.  I wonder how the game might have been different if the Spurs had made a concerted effort for Manu to drive the lane, since that's where Rasheed tends to pick up fouls.
