<p>
I've decided to take this issue slowly; most people's "solutions" are already assuming a certain definition of the problem, which is rarely stated.
</p>
<p>
The problem has little to do with Mozilla's ability to display remote XUL.  This just makes a convincing spoof easier, although it limits the spoof to Mozilla-based browsers, and usually to a subset of versions.  Similar things can be done in IE with a lot of work on some very clever styling and javascript.
</p>
<p>
The problem is this: pieces of the "chrome" (browser interface, as opposed to web-content display) can be hidden, and then fake data put in its place that trick the user into thinking that data is part of the browser.
</p>
<p>
But what things can a user be tricked into doing by mistaking content for browser?  There's no danger (security-wise) in hitting a fake back-button, right?  So, here's the problems I can think of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The URL bar, due to passwords-as-part-of-the-url for FTP sites.</li>
<li>A browser-internal pasword dialog (such as the master-password UI)</li>
<li>Any current indicators used to help prevent page-spoofing attacks (spoofs of web-site interface, not browser interface): the security (lock) indicator, be it on the status bar, or as part of the URL bar.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm sure there are some potential attacks I'm missing.  If you know of them, add them.  If I come across them, I'll update this post to include them.  As I see it, the attack fall into two categories: browser-input spoofing, and browser anti-phishing circumvention.  Does that cover it?  Are there other types I'm missing?
