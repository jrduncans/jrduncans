<p>
There's a <a href="http://www.pvrlib.com/">new blog about PVRs</a> (TiVo and the like).  I found this out because the author of the blog dropped me a line to let me know he was using <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/stephenduncanjr/7526167/">this picture</a> I took of Toby.  So, congratulations to Toby on his new-found stardom, and kudos to Flickr tagging and the Creative Commons Attribution license for making this so easy.
