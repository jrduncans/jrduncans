<p>
I just wanted to make some quick comments on one of the movies I recently watched: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029947/">Bringing Up Baby</a>.  The movie was a fun, fast-paced, screwball comedy.  But, more importantly, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000031/">Katherine Hepburn</a> was utterly charming in this movie as a hyper, nutty, self-centered, earnest young woman trying desperately to win over Cary Grant's character.  Actually, her character reminded me of a very exaggerated version of my wife, Diane.  So, of course, I loved the movie.  If you're looking for fun and silly, definitely watch this movie.
