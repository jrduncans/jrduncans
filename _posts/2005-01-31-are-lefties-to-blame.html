hat I've noticed, over and over, is that the bloggers on the right link to you when they agree and ignore the disagreements, and the bloggers on the left link only for the things they disagree with, to denounce you with short posts saying you're evil/stupid/crazy, and don't even seem to notice all the times you've written posts that take their side. Why is this happening? I find it terribly, terribly sad.

While it would be easy to take this as an opportunity to bash liberals, I think there is a potential explanation.  People frequently blog to spread the opinions they feel aren't being given a strong voice elsewhere.  With a mainstream media that slants so far leftward, it's primarily extremist leftist nuts who have incentive to blog.  Could that be why the reaction from leftist bloggers is so different?

<strong>Update</strong>: Josh Poulson writes <a href="http://pun.org/josh/archives/2005/01/right_left.html">a longer post</a> going into detail on the mechanics of how the difference in perception of how much you're voice is heard might affect these kind of reactions.
