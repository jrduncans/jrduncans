<p>
Laura Walker, a friend and classmate of mine from the class of 1999 at S.H.A.P.E. American High School, <a href="http://www.pointerview.com/walker.htm">was killed in Afghanistan</a> on August 18th.  Laura was a terrific person who I wish I'd gotten to know better.  My thoughts are with those whose loss is greatest: her family and all those who loved her.
