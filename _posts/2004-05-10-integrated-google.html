<p>
So, how long before Google starts integrating all it's neat services? 
I'd sure like to see people be registered to post in my blog by already 
having a <a href="http://www.orkut.com">Orkut </a>or <a 
href="http://gmail.google.com/gmail">Gmail</a> account.  Plus 
I'd like to have a single log-on to all the systems.  That's one of the 
nice parts of <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>.
