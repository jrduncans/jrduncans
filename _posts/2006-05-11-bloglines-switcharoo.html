<p>
It's odd.  Suddenly <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing">Tim Bray's ongoing</a> feed was <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/preview?siteid=1071">working correctly</a> in <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>.  Wow!  Atom 1.0 support, finally?  But no, they've just automatically <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/sub/http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/ongoing.atom">switched over his Atom feed to his RSS feed</a>.  I guess that's one way to get rid of complaints...
