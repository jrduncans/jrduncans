...and other feed readers still don't get the basic features right.  What's a heavy reader of feeds to do?

<a href="{% post_url 2005-11-21-bloglines-security-hole %}#113263528321709900">This promise</a> regarding Atom 1.0 support has gone totally unhonored.  I can think of no meaning of "as soon as possible" that means you can't get a simple case that other aggregators handle correctly in almost 5 months.

While <a href="http://weblog.philringnalda.com/2005/11/21/no-ask-what-bloglines-can-do-to-you#comment-32864">this comment</a> shows that they are still alive at Bloglines, that's a long time in coming.  It may have been somewhat triggered by <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/04/13/Bloglines-Breakages">this</a>, but it seems that some of the problems there are probably still open.

But the biggest problem is that their general unresponsiveness and lack of timely fixes has led to speculative posts <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/04/14/Bloglines-Security-Fixes#c1145063796">such as this</a>.  How can a company built around blogging be so bad at communicating?
