The San Antonio Spurs won game 2 over the Sonics without much difficulty, taking a 2 game lead.  The Spurs are doing well, and should win the series pretty easily.  I shoudl be happy and calm, but I've got a couple complaints that are really bugging me.
</p>
<p>
The first is the refereeing.  We're winning, so this isn't about being sore about the outcome.  But the refs were horrible tonight anyway.  Come on NBA, is this what you want, to encourage whining?  Ray Allen drew several bogus calls on Bowen after complaining before the series and since game 1.  It's a shame that yapping about how much you're fouled is an effective strategy, and I fear the amount of whining that other players will start doing if it remains such a good tactic.

My second complaint is about the announcers.  Quit giving Jerome James the benefit of the doubt!  He's not a good player.  He had one good series against a team who's inside precense consisted entirely of an injured Brad Miller, who's never been a strong defender anyway.  Now he's playing against Duncan, Mohammed, etc., and he looks as bad as he is.  Stop pretending that he's suddenly going to "step-it-up" and be a factor.  Don't suggest that Sonics try to get the ball inside to him more often!  It makes you all look ignorant.  He's a mediocre player.  Please, please, comprehend this simple fact.  He's averaging 5 points and 3 rebounds per game this year.  Sheesh!
