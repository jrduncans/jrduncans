<p>
As a web developer, and as a web surfer, I want the web to do more.  But I want don't want that to come at the cost of locking people into an browser or operating system choice.  That's why supporting a browser like <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=820&amp;t=73">Firefox</a> is so important.  Firefox is cross-platform, so you're not locked into an OS.  Firefox has support for new web standards and technologies.  It's doing things like increasing the visibility of syndication feeds, supporting CSS standards, and working on new extensions to HTML.  Firefox helps make the web better.

To succeed, it needs market share.  This creates an incentive to make web-sites standards-compliant and cross-browser compatible.  So, if you agree that this is an important cause, how can you help?  Join <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=user/register&amp;r=820">SpreadFirefox.com</a> to find out about new initiatives to spread the usage of Firefox.
