<p>
I'm looking for feedback on my <a class="internal" href="/projects/xpathreplacement-maven-plugin/index.html">XPath Replacement Maven Plugin</a>.  It's barebones right now; please send me any ideas you have on how to make it better, or just let me know if you'r even interested in it.  The goal of the plugin is to allow you to do configuration (similar to normal Ant/Maven filtering), but without requiring placeholders so that your source version has a valid value that let's a developer get going straight from source.
</p>
<p>
I also updated the <a class="internal" href="/projects/easymock-propertyutils/index.html">EasyMock Property Utilities</a> site to include the example posted here on the blog.
