<p>
Rather than a story-book ending for Zinedine Zidane, he's sent off after being red-carded for a totally classless move: head-butting an Italian player in the chest.  Whether his team will also lose the World Cup final remains to be seen...

<p>
<strong>Update</strong>: Zidane's team, France, do lose.

<strong>Update 2</strong>: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoADvPC7IvI">Video of the incident</a>.
