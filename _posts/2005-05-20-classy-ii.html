I talked about <a class="internal" href="{% post_url 2005-05-02-classy %}">the classiness of the Denver Nuggets fans</a> last round.  The Seattle Supersonics fans decided they needed to one-up them.  They didn't just perform audible chants of "bull-shit" in every home game, multiple times per game.  There was also a sizeable contigent that cheered when it appeared that Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs had injured his ankle, and then booed when he was able to get up and walk it off.  Congratulations Sonics fans: you suck the most!
