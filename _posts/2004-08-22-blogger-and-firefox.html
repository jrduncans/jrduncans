<p>
As I'm working through the new design, I happened to notice a link about <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=930">supported browsers</a> for Blogger.
</p>
<p>
The interesting part is at the bottom.  Including "6% use Mozilla Firefox; an up-and-comer, which we all use internally." and "AOL users, as well as those unaccounted for here (Netscape, Opera, etc.), would be wise to use Mozilla Firefox in order to have the best possible experience using Blogger.", in addition to a "Get Firefox" button at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
Now if Google as a whole would develop some of their IE/Windows add-ons (Google Toolbar, Gmail notifier) as Firefox extensions, that would really be awesome.
