If you played on the boys soccer team (either with me or before or after me) at SHAPE High School under Mr. Tony Blasio, then go sign up at this site: <a href="http://www.shapespartanssoccer.com/">www.shapespartanssoccer.com</a>.

Also, does anybody with a SHAPE yearbook from 1998 or 1999 think they could scan in the men's soccer yearbook photo?  Unfortunately, I don't have a scanner, and I only have the 1999 yearbook.
