Fairly accurate towards the top, although I wasn't happy with some of the questions and the wording of the answers.  And the accuracy gets worse in my opinion.  I think I have more in common with Hobbes than Kant, for instance.  And, from the description provided on their site, I can't see anything in common with Ockham.
