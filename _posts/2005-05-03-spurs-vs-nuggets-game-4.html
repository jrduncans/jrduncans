<p>
The San Antonio Spurs win in overtime, despite what Charles Barkley called "One of the worst officiated games I've ever seen in my 20 years associated with the NBA."  Duncan played well, but fouled out in overtime.  Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili picked up their games even further in overtime to seal the win.  Spurs up 3-1, hopefully they'll close out at home so they don't give any rest-advantage to their 2nd round opponent.
