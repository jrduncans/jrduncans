<p>
I've started to read a lot of <a class="internal" href="/blogroll.asp">political blogs</a>, and I wanted a way to share the best stuff I see out there.  I also want to discuss politics every once in a while.  But, I definitely don't want to bombard my normal audience (interested in my personal life, or technical posts) with poltical stuff.  I don't much like reading other techies politics stuff in their normal blog, so I do you do either.

<p>
So, I took advantage of the fact that <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> let's you create multiple blogs.  So, now I have a <a class="internal" href="/politics">Political Blog</a>.  If you're interested, check it out, or <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/sub/http://www.stephenduncanjr.com/politics/blog.xml">subscribe </a> with <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> to keep up with all the best commentary I find on the web on politics, or, occasionally, my own commentary.
