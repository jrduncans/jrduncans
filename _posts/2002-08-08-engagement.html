This might not be the best place to announce this, since I don't know if anyone reads it.  Plus it's a little late.  But for the records, at least: On July 17, 2002 I asked Diane Godfrey to marry me and she said yes.  So there you go, I'm engaged.  Current plans are for getting married December 25, 2003.
