I've [created a project](http://code.google.com/p/jrduncans/) on [Google Code Hosting](http://code.google.com/hosting/). It's really just a
place for me to put code I'm playing with so that it's version-controlled and accessible anywhere. Right now it has a simple command-line
draw-the-high-card game that I'm using to try to learn [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

While there may be [valid reasons](http://jroller.com/page/fate?entry=another_googleturd) that Google Code Hosting isn't good enough to
really compete for hosting real open-source projects, for my needs nothing beats the no-barrier-to-entry factor here. If nothing else, it's
nice to have a proper SVN repository available to me for free.
