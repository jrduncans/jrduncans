It only took [9 years]({% post_url 2009-03-15-jquery-for-archives %}){: .internal}, but I finally updated my whole site to use a static generator tool.
In the meantime, [Webby](https://github.com/TwP/webby) has been discontinued, and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) has become the dominant
tool of choice. It took a little while, but I'm happy to feel full in control of things again.

In the process of converting I've fixed a few broken links, removed several that couldn't be fixed
([Unmaintained Web Applications]({% post_url 2008-06-19-unmaintained-web-applications %}){: .internal} strikes again)
and removed Google Analytics (sorry for contributing to privacy erosion for the sake of vanity stats).

It's been fun (and occasionally cringe-inducing) to scan over the blog history while I was doing tweaks on the conversion to Jekyll.
Knowing my history, I won't try to claim that I'll start updating the site regularly now, but I'll probably make an attempt for a
little while, at least.
