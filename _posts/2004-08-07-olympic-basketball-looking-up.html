It's good to see the US improving, as I've now watched the US barely beat Germany, and decisively beat Serbia and Montenegro.  And they did it by playing to their strengths: use superior athleticism to play pressure defense, and get most of their offense through the transition game.  In fact, they looked a lot like a Roy Williams coached Kansas team: getting the "secondary break" as announcers referred to it.

And that's exactly what they need to improve on further.  Kansas was known for managing to fast-break even after made shots by the other team.  The US team must take full advantage of their superior speed and depth.  And I think we can mark the loss to Italy  as being due to jet-lag.  Not to insult the Italian team: with the way they shot, we still would have lost.  Just not by so much.
