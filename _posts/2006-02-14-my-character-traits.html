<p>
Despite my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/02/10/530031.aspx">misuse of the term</a> in <a href="http://www.stephenduncanjr.com/2006/02/memetrackers.shtml">this post</a>, I don't frequently participate in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">"memes"</a>.  But <a href="http://jasonlove.livejournal.com/43671.html">this one from Jason</a> seems like a good one.  Basically, I selected adjectives describing my personality traits, and now you will select them too, and we can compare the overlap or lack thereof.  Without further ado, here's the <a href="http://kevan.org/johari?name=jrduncans">more-or-less positive list</a>, and here is the <a href="http://kevan.org/nohari?name=jrduncans">mostly negative list</a>.  Please take the time to fill it out if you know me, as the number of synonyms requires a large sample size to get any useful aggregation of results...
