<p>
<a href="http://www.chipstacker.net/">Ryan Spanier</a> has <a href="http://www.chipstacker.net/After%20Tech/Vegas/index.htm">pictures</a> up from his trip to the joint AFCENT/SHAPE reunion that was held in Las Vegas.  The only people I recognize are <a href="http://www.chipstacker.net/After%20Tech/Vegas/pages/100_0558.htm">Jared Whitney</a>, <a href="http://www.chipstacker.net/After%20Tech/Vegas/pages/100_0560.htm">Kori Whitney</a> (on the left), and <a href="http://www.chipstacker.net/After%20Tech/Vegas/pages/100_0562.htm">Kristen Martin</a>, who looks prettier when <a href="http://www.chipstacker.net/After%20Tech/Vegas/pages/100_0564.htm">she's smiling</a> :) (Ryan's on the far right).
