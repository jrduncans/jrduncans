<p>
<a href="http://www.broadbandnewsnet.com/newsmanager/anmviewer.asp?a=2294&amp;z=1">David Robinson sued by Major League Baseball</a>  Is there a more idiotic publicity move than this?  A logo that hasn't been used in nine years, and the only commonality is that it has an interlocking C &amp; A.  Not the same colors, not the same font, and, of course, the Carver Academy has no halo over the "A".  I'm no lawyer, but I'm not even sure that qualifies as potential trademark infringement.
