I recently bought three albums: Paramore's "<a href='http://www.amazon.com/Brand-New-Eyes-Paramore/dp/B002FRNCG0/'>Brand New Eyes</a>", Rise Against's "<a href='http://www.amazon.com/Appeal-Reason-Rise-Against/dp/B001FYRNJQ/'>Appeal To Reason</a>", and Kings of Leon's "<a href='http://www.amazon.com/Only-Night-Kings-Leon/dp/B001C3KCSY/'>Only By The Night</a>".  So far, "Brand New Eyes" is the one grabbing my attention with several good songs and some variety of style.  And, as always with Paramore, Hayley Williams' voice is amazing.

After "Ignorance", the angry song getting play on radio (angry songs are always fun to get into and sing along with), "Brick By Boring Brick" is my next favorite on the album.  After listening the song and going over the lyrics on Friday night, we watched Dollhouse, and the ending of the show reminded me strongly of one verse:
</p>
<pre>
Well, if it's not real
You can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true
You can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah
</pre>
<p>
While it doesn't match the song overall (on Dollhouse, it wasn't Sierra's choice to be in a "relationship" that wasn't real), the match up of Sierra recognizing her love for Victor even without any memory of him and "if it's true, you can see it with your eyes, oh, even in the dark" connected to me.  Especially as Diane and I had been discussing how much to read into the "even in the dark" part of the song (balancing the fantasy/escapism the song is against vs "true/real" dreams/faith).
</p>

We watched Gran Torino last night, which was better than I thought it would be.  Now I'm looking forward to watching a football match (Arsenal v West Ham) and a football game (Dallas Cowboys v Atlanta Falcons) today.
