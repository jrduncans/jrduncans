<p>
I've recently finished reading all of <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/blog-rants">Steve Yegge's blog-rants</a>.  The overarching theme is Steve searching for ways to do better at software development.  For instance, <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/being-the-averagest">Being the Averagest</a> on why many programmers aren't trying to get better, and <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/practicing-programming">Practicing Programming</a> on how to get better for those who listened and decided they want to try.  He also chronicles his search for a <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/language-grubbing">better</a> <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/tour-de-babel">programming</a> <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/language-trickery-and-ejb">language</a>.  I suggest reading all of the essays; hopefully they'll inspire you to be a better programmer, and you can take advantage of the work "Stevey" has done to guide you down the path of improvement.  Stevey wrote all these articles while working at Amazon; make sure to also check out his <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com">current blog</a> now that he works at Google.
