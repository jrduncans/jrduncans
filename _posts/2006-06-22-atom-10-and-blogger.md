Bloglines now has Atom 1.0 support, and though there are [some problems](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/06/21/Forward-Motion)
there still, it's time for a new target.  I'm sure it's clear from all my posts that I'm a big proponent of Atom 1.0.  However, I probably
appeared to be a bit of a hypocrite, using an aggregator that didn't support it, and only providing a deprecated Atom 0.3 feed. It's true,
I'm also lazy and picky, and haven't wanted to make a change in software over these issues. It's so much more satisfying to simply complain
and wait for the software to change so that I don't have to.

To continue that trend: What's up with [Blogger](http://blogger.com) still producing Atom 0.3 feeds? Initially, it seemed
[Google](http://www.google.com) gave the Atom movement a big boost by supporting it in Blogger. But now the Atom 1.0 specification has been
out for quite some time, and usage of Atom 0.3 is discouraged. Hopefully the reason for not changing yet was fear about support in
aggregators, and with [Bloglines](http://bloglines.com) probably being the biggest (most users) holdout, maybe now is the time to start
seeing Blogger produce Atom 1.0.  A geek can dream...

So, who are the bloggers with clout or at least information about Blogger?  I had been trying to read the blogs of several Blogger engineers,
but they mostly moved on, I believe.
