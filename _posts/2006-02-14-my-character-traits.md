Despite my [misuse of the term](http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/02/10/530031.aspx) in
[this post]({% post_url 2006-02-08-memetrackers %}){: .internal}, I don't frequently participate in
["memes"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme). But [this one from Jason](http://jasonlove.livejournal.com/43671.html) seems like a good one.
Basically, I selected adjectives describing my personality traits, and now you will select them too, and we can compare the overlap or lack
thereof. Without further ado, here's the [more-or-less positive list](http://kevan.org/johari?name=jrduncans), and here is the
[mostly negative list](http://kevan.org/nohari?name=jrduncans). Please take the time to fill it out if you know me, as the number of synonyms requires a large sample size to get any useful aggregation of results...
