<p>
I've finally written <a class="internal" href="http://www.stephenduncanjr.com/politics/2005/07/how-politicized-focus-can-taint.shtml">another post</a> over on my politics blog.  For those that read before, and may have been concerned over the somewhat conservative tone during the election, you may wish to read this post, as I do go after a bit of what I perceive to be conservative hypocrisy.
