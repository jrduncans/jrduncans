Another note: <a href="http://www.nationstates.net">Nation States</a>
</p>
<p>
A great, fun little web game.  You make a country, however you'd like, and decide on issues to run your country.  I've got 3 countries, because, well, I do things over-the-top.  
</p>
<p>
Anyway, if for some reason there is someone out there actually reading by weblog, despite the my lack of posting, who isn't already involved in this, they (YOU) should go to <a href="http://www.nationstates.net">Nation States</a> and make a country or two, and move them to the Screaming Spheres region.  My countries and several other friends countries are there.  
</p>
<p>
See how my countries are turning out:

<li><a href="http://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?target=display_nation&amp;nation=Donnachaidh">Donnachaidh</a> - My serious attempt</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?target=display_nation&amp;nation=All_That_Is_Good">All That Is Good</a> - My attempt at a superpower</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?target=display_nation&amp;nation=Puritania">Puritania</a> - I think the name says it all.</li>
</ul>
