<p>
Today I worked further toward my goal of rearranging and cleaning up our apartment.  I bought some clothes-hangers and new laundry hampers to organize Diane and I's closet.  I also bought a 5-shelf bookshelf to finally clean up the baskets and boxes of extra books we have.  That's 4 bookshelves we already own.  Also moved a desk out to the living room to hold this computer once I get my new one.  I am oh-so looking forward to it.  Yay!  Christmas was fun.  Nothing fancy, just calm, relaxing, warm, and enjoyable.  Plus food.  Whee!
