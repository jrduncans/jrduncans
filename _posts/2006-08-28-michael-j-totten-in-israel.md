[Michael J. Totten](http://www.michaeltotten.com/) is a fantastic independent journalist. He's currently in Isreal. Check out his
[latest piece on Gaza](http://www.michaeltotten.com/archives/001251.html). Or
[this piece from the Israel-Lebanon border](http://www.michaeltotten.com/archives/001238.html). Hopefully from there you'll want to read
everything he's been writing. If, like me, you find that Michael is providing valuable information in a direct fashion you can't get
elsewhere, then make sure to donate some money to him so he can keep reporting from the Middle East.
