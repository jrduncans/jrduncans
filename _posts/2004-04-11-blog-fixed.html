Well, if you've visited before, you'll notice that my Blog is now integrated with the rest of my website.  It's also valid XHTML (well, at least as valid as the rest of the site; <a href="http://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml">Some disagree</a>).  Obviously, if I switch to a system allowing comments, maintaining validity will be harder...

The Archive still has to be done (it's using the old template, and I have to go over old posts to classify links, and to make sure no bad html is in them.  But, for now, it's off to bed...
