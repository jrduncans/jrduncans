I've been watching a bunch of movies during my time off for Christmas, but none have really stuck out.  Tonight, however, I finished watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338097/combined">Head in the Clouds</a>, and was very impressed.  Critics have been very harsh to it, apparently, but I thought it was a great personal-level story of politics, war, and hedonism in 1930's and '40's Europe, the Spanish Civil War and World War II.  Not a classic movie, but definitely good and worth seeing.
