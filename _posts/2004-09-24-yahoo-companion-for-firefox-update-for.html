<p>
The <a href="http://companion.mozdev.org/installation.html">Yahoo! Companion Toolbar for Firefox</a> has been updated to work with Firefox 1.0 Preview Release.  Plus, several bugs have been fixed, so it should be much more usable.  Go download it!  (That means you, <a href="http://www.idealens.com">Chris!</a>).

<p>
Note, only the installation page is updated.  The front page hasn't changed to show the new version.  I edited the link to go straight to the installation page.
