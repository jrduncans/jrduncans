<a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/006944.html">Brendan's Roadmap Updates: OpenLaszlo and Eclipse</a>
</p>
<p>
Brendan notes that Laszlo has released an IDE for LZX based on Eclipse.  Noting the similarity of LZX and XUL, he asks for takers on patching it to support XUL.  I hope we do find a taker, as that will be a huge step in allowing for people to adopt XUL.  Not that <a class="internal" href="{% post_url 2004-11-19-open-sourcestandard-xml-user-interface %}">yesterday's thoughts</a> don't still apply.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update</strong>: Brendan says they (Mozilla folks) are talking with the Laszlo people.

<blockquote>
<p>
Stephen: we are already talking to Laszlo folks, and we'll see what can be done quickly. It may not pay to converge and standardize, instead of harmonize. Laszlo would love to target native support in Firefox, of course, but that's another Gecko extension to be written. If LZX evolves to use CSS and the full DOM and ECMA-262 Edition 3, then it's a better match to a future Gecko (+ extension) target.
