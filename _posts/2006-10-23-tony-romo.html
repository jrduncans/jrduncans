While I've been frustrated by Bledsoe's consistency, I was never among the Dallas Cowboy fans that was calling for Tony Romo to replace Bledsoe.  I didn't think an unproven quarterback could make much difference.  But the drive I just watched Tony Romo lead was very impressive.  No matter how tonight's game finishes, I see Romo as the quarterback for the Cowboys for the rest of the season.  The biggest benefit: it looks like Dallas games will be more exciting on the offensive end.

<strong>Update</strong>: Well, Romo made enough mistakes to make my prediction that he will be the QB the rest of the season questionable.  I think I'd still prefer Romo, but I'm not sure if Bill Parcells will agree.
