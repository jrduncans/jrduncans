<p>
I've <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jrduncans/">created a project</a> on <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google Code Hosting</a>.  It's really just a place for me to put code I'm playing with so that it's version-controlled and accessible anywhere.  Right now it has a simple command-line draw-the-high-card game that I'm using to try to learn <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.

<p>
While there may be <a href="http://jroller.com/page/fate?entry=another_googleturd">valid reasons</a> that Google Code Hosting isn't good enough to really compete for hosting real open-source projects, for my needs nothing beats the no-barrier-to-entry factor here.  If nothing else, it's nice to have a proper SVN repository available to me for free.
