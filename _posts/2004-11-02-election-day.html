I voted today, at around 4:30 pm.  Happily, my polling place is just a block and a half away.  The line was not too long, though it had been longer earlier in the day, apparently.  The touch-screen system was pretty fool-proof as long as you assume that DieBold can guarentee that what my vote showed up as on the screen is what will get registered.  Is it so hard to provide a paper receipt that I can check and turn in, to be used in the case of a recount?

There were only two positions on the ballot here.  I actually voted straight Republican.  I voted pretty much straight Libertarian last election, so take it for what you will.
