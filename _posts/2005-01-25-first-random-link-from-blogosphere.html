<p>
Today, I found the first reference to my name in my Bloglines search feed.  <a href="http://demiliani.com/blog/">Stefano Demiliani</a> apparently <a href="http://demiliani.com/blog/archive/2005/01/25/2137.aspx">liked my</a> tip on <a href="{% post_url 2005-01-19-seeing-relnofollow %}">seeing rel="nofollow"</a>.  I guess I need to keep posting <em>useful</em> stuff if I want to become an active member of the blogosphere...
