The San Antonio Spurs got a solid win against the Pistons in Game one of the NBA Finals.  The Spurs struggled early, but in the 4th quarter, Manu Ginobili really picked up his game, and finished with 26 points on 10 of 16 shooting.  Another amazing performance in the end.  I'll let <a href="http://nbaspurs.blogspot.com/">Matthew</a> give you the real analysis.  All I have to say is: Tim Duncan played great too, but Manu just put up his first piece in a portfolio that may lead to a Finals MVP for Ginobili, rathar than Timmy if the Spurs take the series.
