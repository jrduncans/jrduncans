<a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2004_10_03_althouse_archive.html#109735870059333930">Ann Althouse:  "Kerry's Undeclared War."</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this light, consider the quote, also in the NYT article, from Richard Holbrooke, who seems to be the most likely candidate for Kerry's secretary of state:

    "We're not in a war on terror, in the literal sense. The war on terror is like saying 'the war on poverty.' It's just a metaphor. What we're really talking about is winning the ideological struggle so that people stop turning themselves into suicide bombers.'' 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There's the difference between Kerry and Bush regarding foreign policy.  Offense vs. Defense.  War versus police actions only.  We fight and kill them and stop <strong>them</strong>, or we attempt to change ourselves in some way to get the terrorists to stop <em>wanting</em> to kill us.
</p>
<p>
What do I think of Kerry's plan?  "Fat chance."  I don't think it's possible to win in an idealogical struggle, other than by spreading liberty and democracy and wealth to the entire world.  I'm not exactly looking forward to the number of terrorist attacks that occur before we acheive <em>that</em>.  Am I missing something?
