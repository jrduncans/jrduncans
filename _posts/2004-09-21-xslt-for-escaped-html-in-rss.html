I was having a major problem with this, and was going to post here and ask for help.  But in my attempts to document what I'd been searching for already, I found what I hope will prove to be <a href="http://www.alazanto.org/journals/technical/2003/08/#embedded_formatting_for_mozilla">the answer</a>.  I'll find out tomorrow if it helps.  Feel free to take a shortcut to the <a href="http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/c.evans/proto/MoveableTypeXSLT/">technical details</a>.
