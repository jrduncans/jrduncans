<p>
Well, it is for where I live.  Virginia was redistricted in 2001.  This <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/redistrict/story17.html">was controversial</a> due to state Republicans being accused of attempting to pack black voters into the 3rd District.  What district am I in? Well, as of 2001, the 3rd District.  According to the 1999 district lines, which the Virginia state government web site <a href="http://www.virginia.gov/cmsportal/services_869/services_1111/election_1476/index.html">still shows as current</a>, I would have been in the 2nd District.  The 3rd District would have started exactly a block over from me.

According to the <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?012+ful+HB18ER">bill setting the districts from 2001</a>, my precinct (the St. Andrews precinct) is the only one in Norfolk that is split: part of it is in the 2nd District, part in the 3rd.
