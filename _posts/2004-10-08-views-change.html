<a href="http://baldilocks.typepad.com/baldilocks/2004/10/drying_out.html">Baldilocks - Drying Out</a> - Another great essay on this presidential election.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Those of us who know that none of the domestic issues being brought up in the election run-up matter a whit if we’re dead, want to do our best to vote for the guy who will ensure that our mass domestic death doesn’t occur (again). The strangest phenomenon—to me, at any rate—is that the guy who seems to have done the most to keep that next mass death from happening seems to bring out violent, wigged-out opposition in roughly half of the constituent population that he’s attempting to protect. Call this bottle “September 10, 2001.”
