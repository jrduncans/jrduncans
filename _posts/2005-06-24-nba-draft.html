Even though the Spurs pick 28th this year, I'm still interested in the draft.  One reason is that <a href="http://nbadraft.net/profiles/waynesimien.asp">Wayne Simien</a>, the star of my alma mater, Kansas, might be available for the Spurs.  In fact, that's exactly where <a href="http://nbadraft.net">NBADraft.net has him</a>.  Other mock drafts I've seen have him going before 28th, or have him getting passed over by the Spurs.

Honestly, with Luis Scola coming in, there may be too much similarity in the players, and the Spurs may pass up a chance at Simien.  But having watched Simien, I think he's underrated for the draft, and will be a successful NBA player.  He's very tough, can rebound well, and has an excellent mid-range shot for a 6'9" player.

Guessing at what's available at pick #28, and knowing enough about all these players, is very difficult.  Who knows what the Spurs will really do; maybe they'll trade the pick for a future one, maybe they'll make another impressive choice of someone most of us have never heard of late in the draft.  But I look forwrd to finding out.
