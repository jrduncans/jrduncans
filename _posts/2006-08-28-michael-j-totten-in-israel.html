<p>
<a href="http://www.michaeltotten.com/">Michael J. Totten</a> is a fantastic independent journalist.  He's currently in Isreal.  Check out his <a href="http://www.michaeltotten.com/archives/001251.html">latest piece on Gaza</a>.  Or <a href="http://www.michaeltotten.com/archives/001238.html">this piece from the Israel-Lebanon border</a>.  Hopefully from there you'll want to read everything he's been writing.  If, like me, you find that Michael is providing valuable information in a direct fashion you can't get elsewhere, then make sure to donate some money to him so he can keep reporting from the Middle East.
