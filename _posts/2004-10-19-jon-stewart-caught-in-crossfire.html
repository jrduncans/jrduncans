<a href="http://jimtreacher.com/archives/001068.html">Summary on the Jon Stewart Crossfire thing</a>.  I thought I'd have to summarize my thought on it, but Jim Treacher does it well enough for me.

<p>
Stewart's been bugging me... I've been getting more and more annoyed with him trying to have it both ways, being an increasingly self-righteous advocate and yet deflecting criticism with "It's just a comedy show!" Which is pretty much perfectly encapsulated in his 15-odd minutes on Crossfire. I remember when he was a lot more convincing about being a moderate, not that long ago. And I think his interview with Kerry is certainly fair game for criticism. But then again, calling Tucker Carlson a dick? Right to his face? That is a Golden TV Moment.
