Game 1 between the San Antonio Spurs and the Detroit Pistons is still close late, and it's a good defensive game.  But one thing not good so far is the announcing.  The analysis is fine: nothing amazingly insightful, but nothing rediculous either.  However, they are being really lazy when it comes to be factually accurate about what's going on.  Not really going back to check replays to figure out if the right call was made, etc.  It's getting a bit annoying...
