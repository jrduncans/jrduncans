I have released [EasyMock-PropertyUtils 1.1](/projects/easymock-propertyutils/index.html){: .internal}, and it's available
[in the Maven repository](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/stephenduncanjr/easymock-propertyutils/1.1/) or for
[download directly](http://jrduncans.googlecode.com/files/easymock-propertyutils-1.1.zip). If you have issues,
[post them at the Google Code site](http://code.google.com/p/jrduncans/issues/list), or ask at the
[Google Group/Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/easymock-propertyutils). 

The main changes from 1.0 are:

* Ability to match against an object
* Static matcher methods are renamed to `propEq`
