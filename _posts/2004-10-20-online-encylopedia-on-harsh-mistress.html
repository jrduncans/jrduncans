<p>
<a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/The%20Moon%20is%20a%20Harsh%20Mistress">Encyclopedia Article on The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a>.  A good summary of several aspects of this tremendous novel that managed to be important in so many different ways.  It should really get more credit from academics.  However, the article doesn't seem to really mention that the novel is also analagous to the American Revolution.  By the way, is there a literary term for that?  Nothing is coming to mind...
