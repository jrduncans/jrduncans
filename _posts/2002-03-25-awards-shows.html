I have lost faith (once again) in the ability of awards show to make judgements properly.  Sure, I didn't actually see the other movies, but it is <em>inconceivable</em> that <strong>A Beautiful Mind</strong> is an example of a better directing job than <strong>Lord of the Rings.</strong>  For Peter Jackson not to be recognized for the amazing work he did is rediculous.
