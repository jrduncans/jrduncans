<p>
<a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20050304.html">Today's "Ask Yahoo!"</a> has successfully made me feel old, at age 23.  Although, to be fair, my memory of the answer comes after the answer given.  To me, the "B" drive was almost always the 5 1/2" floppy drive.  I'm kind of surprised that wasn't mentioned in the answer.
