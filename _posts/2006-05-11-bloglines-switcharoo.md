It's odd. Suddenly [Tim Bray's ongoing](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing) feed was
[working correctly](http://www.bloglines.com/preview?siteid=1071) in [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com). Wow! Atom 1.0 support, finally?
But no, they've just automatically
[switched over his Atom feed to his RSS feed](http://www.bloglines.com/sub/http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/ongoing.atom). I guess that's one
way to get rid of complaints...
