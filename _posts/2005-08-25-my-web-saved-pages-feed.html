<p>
My Web has made more of their pages public.  That includes the ability to get RSS feeds!  So, <a href="http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com/mywebrss/user/.IBOSPOaUuY0aH7iu3Y-/urls.xml">here's my feed</a> for my public saved pages.  Think of it like a second linkblog, but less focused on timeliness, and more focused on usefulness.
