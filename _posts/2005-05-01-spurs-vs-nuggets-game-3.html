The Spurs grind out a good win over Denver, taking back home-court advantage.  So, so far the San Antonio Spurs have: lost by only 6 playing badly, especially Duncan, won by 28 points playing well, and then had Duncan play badly and still win by 8.

Manu Ginobili played excellently, stepping up his game with Tim having an off-night.  But the guy who never gets enough credit is Bruce Bowen.  His continued success completely thwarting Carmelo Anthony is just another sign that he absolutely deserves to be Defensive Player of the Year for 2005.
