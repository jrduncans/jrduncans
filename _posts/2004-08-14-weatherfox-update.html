<p>There's a new homepage for <a href="http://weatherfox.mozdev.org/">WeatherFox</a>.  Improvements are still coming quickly, which is nice.

By the way, "LiveMarks" or "Live Bookmarks" or whatever the current name for RSS in Firefox as bookmarks currently is, doesn't seem to be all that useful.  Which, in a way, is good.  People using tools like Bloglines cuts down on the hits to people's feeds.
