Go, <a href="http://www.pointlesswasteoftime.com/games/manifesto.html">read it</a>, now!  It's so right on, that I may just ask the authors their religion, so that I might achieve everlasting peace and happiness.

Actually...I think the XBox's music features are nice (customize the playlist within all games from your music collection), and look forward to perhaps being able to play basketball without listening to hip-hop.  And I liked Dead or Alive: Beach Volleyball, and so did my wife.   In fact, since I don't own an XBox, I hope that the backwards compatibility of the XBox 360 will allow me to purchase DOA: Beach Volleyball to play on the 360...

But that's not the point.  The point is that I agree with <em>almost</em> all of it!
