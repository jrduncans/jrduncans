<p>
Want help finding music that you'll like?  <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> is a system for doing that based on musical analysis of songs.  You put in an artist or song, and it creates a "station" based on that artist or song, playing similar songs.  For now it's free during preview, so sign up to try it out.
