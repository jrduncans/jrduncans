This is my current biggest complaint with the TiVo interface.  If I have a show I want to record, and there are multiple showings, why do I have to manually check each to determine if they conflict with stuff I already have scheduled to record?  How hard could it possibly be to check for the conflicts against my current schedule before showing me the available showings?  This is a pretty major deficiency in my mind.
