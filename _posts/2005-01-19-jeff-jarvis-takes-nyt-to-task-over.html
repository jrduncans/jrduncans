<a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2005_01_18.html#008905">Jeff Jarvis: Shame on the New York Times</a>.  Jeff provides a detailed rebuttal, as well as an ethical condmenation of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/18/arts/18blog.html?oref=login">this NYT article</a>.  Jeff, ever the optimist, considers this an attempt to improve journalism and the NYT:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
: Let me make one thing very clear: I like, read, and respect The New York Times and I care about journalism and that is why it's worth going after this story: to turn journalism into a self-correcting mechanism, as we call our new medium.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I'm not feeling that optimistic.  I take it, instead, as another sign journalism right now is a very sick industry.  It seems likely that it will take something more drastic before the problem is fixed.
