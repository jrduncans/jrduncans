I just watched [Definitely, Maybe](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0832266/) with Diane as our Valentine's day thing.
It was fantastically cute and sweet. Ryan Reynolds was funny and charming, as usual. Isla Fischer was very likeable and adorable.
Abigail Breslin, however, stole the show as the precocious and completely sweet daughter. I found the movie very enjoyable, though I am a
total sucker for all forms of romantic comedies.
