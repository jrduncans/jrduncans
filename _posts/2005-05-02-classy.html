Just wanted to post about this while I remembered: you gotta love the classiness of the Denver Nuggets fans.  For the second game in a row they get an extremely audible chant of "bull-shit" going.  I don't recall for sure if they had any cause in Game 3.  However, in Game 4, they are completely wrong.  It wasn't even close: Nene was clearly not in position to get a charge called.

Also, the refereeing at the end of the Dallas-Houston game was quite bad, in that they missed two very big calls.  I've got no preference between these two teams, but Houston was hurt pretty bad by: the missed call with Finley getting the steal from out-of-bounds, and the phantom foul call when the Rockets were trying to trap at the end of the game.  A shame to mar a tight game with officiating mistakes.
