<p>
On the new find feature: there is a preference currently called "Enable Find As You Type" that enables the old behavior of being able to just start typing, and have the find features start working.  That makes me happy.

<p>
Each feed that you've bookmarked you can manage options on: you can set the schedule for updating (it defaults to never updating right now), as well as set what kind of notification(s) you want when new posts have been added. 
</p>

<strong>Edit:</strong> Updating/refreshing seems to be broken in this build.  I'll play with the new features some more as bugs are fixed.
