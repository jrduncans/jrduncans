Was that a great game or what?  Finally, they looked like a team that could compete for a National Championship.  Yes, I know that they were playing a depleted Texas team.  But it's not about how easy things were, or about the final score.  It's the fact that showed a full-game's worth of effort.  They pressured at the defensive end all game.  On offense, they played well the full-time too.  They attacked the basket whenever the could.  When they couldn't they passed the ball around well.  They did it against man-to-man and the 2-3 zone.  If they can keep playing like this, then that Villanova game should be forgotten completely...
