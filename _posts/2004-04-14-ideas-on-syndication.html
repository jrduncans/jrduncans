On the one hand, this article focuses on structure that is customized.  On the other hand, I see some utility in doing things like consuming one's e-mail via an RSS-type feeder.  It's not a coindidence that RSS feeders are also called aggregators.  That's another thing they provide other than handling more structure files: a good way to get a condensed version of everything you're interested in all in one place.
