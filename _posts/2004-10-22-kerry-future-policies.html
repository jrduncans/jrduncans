<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A53015-2004Oct21?language=printer">Charles Krauthammer - Sacrificing Israel</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
John Kerry says he wants to "rejoin the community of nations." There is no issue on which the United States more consistently fails the global test of international consensus than Israel. In July, the U.N. General Assembly declared Israel's defensive fence illegal by a vote of 150 to 6. In defending Israel, America stood almost alone.
</p>
<p>
You want to appease the "international community"? Sacrifice Israel. Gradually, of course, and always under the guise of "peace." Apply relentless pressure on Israel to make concessions to a Palestinian leadership that has proved (at Camp David in 2000) it will never make peace.
