Ok, so the Archive is done now too.  I've deleted some old posts (just stupid ones with results from random internet quizzes: too much table hell to fix).  You'd be surprised how much trouble ampersands in URL's can be when trying to validate your blog entries.  All done now.

With all the trouble I've gone through to get this Blogger template working, I think I'll at least stick with it until <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org">Moveable Type</a> releases their 3.0 version.

<p>
Until then, please <a href="mailto:webmaster@stephenduncanjr.com">send me</a> feedback about the site via e-mail.  I intend to do some work on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a> for the blog, as well as work on some better alternate stylesheets in the future.  Remember to use a more advanced browser (i.e. not IE) to get the intended view and full features of my site. :)
