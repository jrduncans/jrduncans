<p>
<a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> just added keyboard shortcuts!  I'd been impressed by the keyboard shortcuts in <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google's new feed reader</a>, but didn't like the interface for reading new items by folder/label instead of all at once (it's possible to do what I do with Bloglines, but it takes up too much screen real-estate when you do).  Now Bloglines has added it.  Not sure it'll work with Bloglines UI quite as well, but still very cool and handy.  Finally a new UI feature in Bloglines!
