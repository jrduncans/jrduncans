<p>
So, first I discover that Blogger supports Atom feeds (rather than RSS).  Cool.  Most readers support it, or so they say.  However, I'm having trouble with various readers I want to use.  SharpReader works fine, but I'm not always on Windows, and I don't really want another program.  The Mozilla extension I <a class="internal" href="{% post_url 2004-04-10-rss %}">mentioned</a> earlier, however, only <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=476349#476349">partially works</a>.  The <a href="http://my.yahoo.com">My Yahoo</a> RSS portlet doesn't seem to recognize it all.  Nor does <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>, which I'd like to use for more extensive feed tracking.
</p>
<p>
As I'm trying to check into this problem, I found an <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/feedvalidator/">Atom validator</a>.  My site <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/feedvalidator/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stephenduncanjr.com%2Fblog.xml">doesn't validate</a>.  But the error message isn't very useful.
</p>
<p>
So, I'm a bit lost.  I've got two hypotheses at the moment: the server's not sending the right MIME-type (I'll check with <a href="http://www.ryangregg.com">Ryan</a> later), or the fact that my blog entries don't have titles is a problem.  That one I'll check on now, I guess...
