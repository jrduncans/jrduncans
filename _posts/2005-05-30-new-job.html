<p>
I've been meaning to blog about this for a little bit.  I've changed positions recently (started the new position on May 16th).  Previously, I worked at the <a href="http://www.jfcom.mil/about/fact_sjfhq.htm">SJFHQ</a>.  I did system administration for Sharepoint Portal Server, provided portal expertise, and did some Java-based web development on the side.
</p>
<p>
The new job is with the same company, and still working for JFCOM.  Now I work at <a href="http://www.jfcom.mil/about/abt_j9.htm">Joint Experimentation</a>, with the team responsible for the <a href="http://www.jfcom.mil/about/fact_iqprt.htm">Iraqi Information Sharing Portal</a>.  So, now I'll be closer to doing full-time software development.  I'll be working on an interesting project, with a larger team, with some experienced developers.  I'm looking forward to the challenges, and the opportunity to learn and improve my skils, while helping a very worhtwhile project for the military.
