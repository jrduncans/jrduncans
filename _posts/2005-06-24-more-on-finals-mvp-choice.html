I <a class="internal" href="{% post_url 2005-06-24-spurs-vs-pistons-game-7 %}">wrote before</a> that Duncan deserved the Finals MVP, even though I felt torn, and that Ginobili was really close.  I voted for Duncan over on the <a href="http://nbaspurs.blogspot.com/2005/06/by-skin-of-their-teeth.html">Spurs Blog poll</a>, and <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/sungo/111959004151438554/">supported that vote</a> in the comments.

But Matt <a href="http://nbaspurs.blogspot.com/2005/06/i-should-just-let-it-go.html">just posted something</a> that convinced me that I was wrong, and that I should have listened to my instincts more.  Ginobili deserved the MVP, and Robert Horry deserved the small consideration, at least, that I was feeling.  Now, you definitely can't take those numbers to mean everything.  But Ginobili's numbers are so good, that there's no doubt he was the most valuable player.  Horry's numbers are also too good to discount through other statistical anomalies.  The rest of the players numbers are probably skewed based on how much they spent on the floor with Ginobili or Horry.
