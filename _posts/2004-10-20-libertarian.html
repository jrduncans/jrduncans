<blockquote>
<p>
But this morning, I hear an NPR story about Libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik and it consigns libertarians right back into the looney bin: Their candidate thinks driver's licenses are unconstitutional, the report says, and so Badnarik makes it a point to get arrested for driving without a license whenever he can to prove his alleged point. This is exactly the image libertarians had for years: impractical, obnoxious loons.

I agree.  It's why it's that other B* candidate that's getting my vote for President this year, not Badnarik.  We need a Libertarian Party that is pragmatic and moderate.  We need a libertarian approach to government, not an attempted libertarian revolution.  Plus we need to get rid of the isolationist wing of the party, no matter how big they are.  That's negligent naivete.  How do we get there?  Hell if I know.
