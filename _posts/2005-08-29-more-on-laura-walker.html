<p>
Searching around to find more information on Laura's death, because obsessively seeking knowledge is how I cope with grief, I found the following article that Laura wrote a few weeks ago about her mission in Afghanistan: <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?The-Route-to-Democracy&amp;id=54419">The Route to Democracy</a>.  Also <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/blog/archives/2005/08/honoring_laura.html">a tribute post</a> from the Ezine blog after finding out that Laura died.
