So many things went wrong in this game, it's hard to catalog them all.  The officiating was bad, and lop-sided, but that's not why the Spurs lost.  Any time both Duncan and Ginobili have bad games, the Spurs are in big trouble.  The Pistons defense does deserve some credit, especially inside on Duncan, but Duncan missed a lot of shots he should make, and Ginobili was unable to play as aggressively as normal, perhaps slightly hampered by the early collision to his thigh/knee.  Expect for the Spurs to play much better next game, and win it, as the Pistons win wasn't nearly as convincing as it should have been, given all the Spurs mistakes (turnovers, etc.).
