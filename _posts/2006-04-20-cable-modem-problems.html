For the last week or so, I'd been having trouble with my internet connection.  I would lose my connection to the outside on a regular basis.  It seemed to get worse over time.  By Monday, it was only up for 2-5 minutes at a time.  Each time I would turn off the cable modem and then turn it back on, I would get a connection for a while, and then it would cut out again.

After my third call to Cox Communications, it was explained to me that the Motorala Surfboard SB3100 was <em>way</em> out of date, and not supported anymore.  Plus it couldn't take advantage of the higher speeds I was paying for anyway.  So I ordered a new Motorola SB5120 and, voila, my internet connection is reliable once again.
