Ok, so my promise of more frequent posting hasn't panned out, as usual.  But anyway, hi, how're you doing?  I've been spending much of my online time recently at <a href="http://www.xforums.net">X-Forums</a>, primarily the Something Positive section.  It's fun and interesting, but maybe you shouldn't read it.  I don't know what all I've said there, and, yeah, it gets interesting so, nevermind.
