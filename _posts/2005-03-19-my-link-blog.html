<a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/Jrduncans">"Links...of...Interest!"</a>
</p>
<p>
I've finally decided to use <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> handy feature, the <a href="http://bloglines.com/about/clipblog">Clip Blog</a>. I'll put all the interesting posts I find, but that I don't have anything interesting to actually say there.  I won't bother to put a synopsis, or anything, so you'll just have to trust my judgment that the posts are worth reading.  By the way, you need to imagine the title of the blog ("Links...of...interest!") as being said the same as "Tales...of...interest!" from <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/GuidePageServlet/showid-249/epid-1562/">this Futurama episode</a>.
