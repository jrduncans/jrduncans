Rather than a story-book ending for Zinedine Zidane, he's sent off after being red-carded for a totally classless move: head-butting an
Italian player in the chest.  Whether his team will also lose the World Cup final remains to be seen...

**Update**: Zidane's team, France, do lose.

**Update 2**: [Video of the incident](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoADvPC7IvI).
