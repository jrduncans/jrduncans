I meant to post about this a long time ago, but when Blogger discontinued publishing via FTP, I hit some snags trying to create a new setup for my blog and website.  If you see this, then I guess I've got it working now; the blog is hosted by Google, and the non-blog parts of the site are served up from an EC2 server at Amazon.

Back to what I meant to post about so very long ago: Say Anything's new <a href="http://www.sayanythingmusic.com/music/say-anything">self-titled album</a> came out November 2009.  It's an excellent album.  I was going to link to a track-by-track explanation of the songs that Max Bemis provided in an interview with AltPress, but apparently it's dropped off the internet.  Instead, I guess I'll just say: check out the album.
