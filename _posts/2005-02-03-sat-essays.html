<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12757-2005Jan15.html">Scorers of New SAT Get Ready for Essays</a>
</p>
<p>
Reading this article felt remarkably similar to watching a horror movie. Revulsion and helplessness top the list of emotions that hit me as the writer banged home the subjectivity of the scores for these essays.  I'm glad this came after my time for the SATs, and I pity those high schoolers now taking them.

I won't be suprised, however, if the scores on the essays do end up being so poor an indicator of the students' abilities that this could eventually be the end of the SATs. They are only useful so long as they are a reasonable predictor of success in college, after all.
