<p>
So, I gave all my posts real titles (titles in the Atom feed had been the first 20 characters of a post).  Not sure if that's what did it, but <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Blog Lines</a> now recognizes my blog just fine.  The RSS portlet panel extension has <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=476349#476349">bugs</a> that someone has posted fixes for.  The <a href="http://my.yahoo.com">My Yahoo</a> RSS portlet never claimed to support Atom feeds anyhow.

The strange thing is that the feed still <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/feedvalidator/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stephenduncanjr.com%2Fblog.xml">doesn't validate</a>.  So I'll check on that.  Maybe look for another site that attempts to validate an Atom feed.  But I guess my problems are mostly resolved, for now.
