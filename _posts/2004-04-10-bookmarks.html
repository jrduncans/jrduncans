Another nice thing Yahoo provides is a place to store all your bookmarks.  By itself, that's not that useful.  But they have the <a href="http://companion.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Companion</a> Toolbar, which integrates into <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp">Internet Explorer</a> .  There's also <a href="http://companion.mozdev.org/">some work</a> to provide a version of this for <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>.  It's still a bit buggy, but it looks promising for those who want the Yahoo Companion in Mozilla or Firefox.

The nice thing about this is that you can load the toolbar on multiple computers, and have shared bookmarks between all your computers.  However, it requires adding a toolbar to your browser, cluttering it up, plus it bypasses your browser's normal bookmark tools.  Well, if you use Firefox (or possibly other Mozilla-based browsers), and you have some FTP space, you can get the <a href="http://cgi29.plala.or.jp/~mozzarel/addon/firefox/bookmarksftp/">Bookmark Synchronizer</a>.  One more way extensions in Firefox are improving the way we can browse the web.
