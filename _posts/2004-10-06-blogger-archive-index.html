<p>
You'll notice that the archive link for the new political blog is broken.  It turns out, Blogger is <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=96&amp;topic=21">no longer supporting an archive index</a> (see the bottom of that page).  That, instead, I should use the template tags to include the archives index on my main blog page.

Does this make sense to anyone else?  I don't want to clutter my front page.  Sure, I could put the links into the sidebar like some people do, but I'd rather the archives be on their own page.  Am I missing something?  Is that my only option now for a new blog?  How should I handle this in my template for the politcs blog?
