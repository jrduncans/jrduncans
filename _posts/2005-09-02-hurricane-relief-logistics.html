Jason at <a href="http://iraqnow.blogspot.com/">COUNTERCOLUMN</a> is a National Guardsman from Florida, with experience in hurricane relief.  He <a href="http://iraqnow.blogspot.com/2005/09/logistics-of-disaster-relief.html">has made</a> <a href="http://iraqnow.blogspot.com/2005/09/military-commandeers-busses-and-more.html">several posts</a> <a href="http://iraqnow.blogspot.com/2005/09/why-couldnt-we-preposition-troops.html">about logistics</a>.  Check out his blog for a dose of rationality compared to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/09/new_orleans_out.html">some of the criticism</a> of the handling of the relief effort so far.
