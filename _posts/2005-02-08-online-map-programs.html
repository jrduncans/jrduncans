Google just gave us <a href="http://maps.google.com/">a new one</a>.  And boy is it good.  First, it gives us what Google does best: a simple search.  You can simply type the whole search in the single simple input field and get your results.  Second, it gives a very slick interface that allows us to interact with the map without getting a full page refresh (I assume it's based on the same concepts as their Gmail interface).    The last feature, and this is under-appreciated one, is that the maps they give us are <strong>big</strong> and <strong>clear</strong>.  A search for a particular address will give you a zoom level where streets have width (rather than lines).  The maps are the easiest to read of any of the map services I've used.

Another cool map service is <a href="http://www.map24.com/">Map 24</a>.  It does give us a lot of Google does, and has an even slicker interface.  It does this by loading an applet, instead of Google's javascript magic.  This also makes it a bit slower to get started, however.  I think Google's going to get most of my usage, though I plan to keep Map 24 in mind for times when I want to explore around an address more.

<a href="http://www.mapquest.com/">Yahoo! Maps</a>, <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/">Mapquest</a>, and <a href="http://mappoint.msn.com/">Microsoft MapPoint</a>: they aren't even in the same ballpark.
