Well, there's no excuses this time.  No jet-lag, no fluke 15 3-pointers.  Just an old-fashioned butt-whooping.
</p>
<p>
The 3-point line is shorter: why do we shoot worse here than in the NBA?  
</p>
<p>
And what did Carmelo Anthony do that made the coaches keep him on the bench?
</p>
<p>
And why didn't the US team try pressure defense until midway through the 3rd quarter?  And why is Stephon Marbury still starting (Wade is better despite his tendency to get frustrated and make mistakes).
</p>
<p>
It ain't over, but Argentina is my second favorite.  Did you see Ginobili's winning shot?  Absolutely amazing.  I only wish that game had come second, so that it would be the fresher moment in my mind.
