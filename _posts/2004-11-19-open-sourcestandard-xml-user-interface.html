I've posted on this topic <a class="internal" href="{% post_url 2004-09-02-rich-internet-applications %}">before</a>.
</p>
<p>
From <a href="http://news.com.com/David+vs.+Goliath+vs.+Goliath/2008-7344_3-5457982.html">an interview with CTO of Laszlo Systems</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But now that the source code is open and available, we're working on establishing alliances to get this platform, especially the LZX language, to be a standard. That benefits us and the industry because this is the open Web. It's open source. It runs everywhere and runs in any browser.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Competition with <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/core/overviews/about%20xaml.aspx">Longhorn's XAML</a> platform from Microsoft is mentioned, but <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/">Mozilla's XUL</a> is not.  What does this  mean for the future of XUL?  Will the split of competitor's between XUL, Laszlo, and the proprietary <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flex/">Macromedia Flex</a> allow Microsoft to win?
</p>
<p>
The primary incompatibility between XUL and Laszlo is that XUL requires some portion of the Mozilla runtime environment to run, whereas Laszlo uses Flash.  With Flash having a much larger install base, people look at Laszlo as being essentially zero-install on the client.
</p>
<p>
What I would like to see is Mozilla and Laszlo work together to come to a standard on the XML UI <em>language</em>.  Then Laszlo could continue to produce a Flash-based implementation, while Mozilla continued to produce it's current implementation.  Both implementations have pros and cons.  Flash is cross browser; Mozilla is themeable, and has more native-like widgets.
</p>
<p>
I don't know what the currently techincal differences are in the languages, so I don't know how far away this concept would be to achieve.  But I really think that it's got to be started now, if open-source is to compete in this field with Microsoft.  Any ideas on how to get this ball rolling?
