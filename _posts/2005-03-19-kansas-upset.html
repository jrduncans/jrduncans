Wow.  So that's it.  That's the rediculously anti-climactic ending to the careers of 4 Kansas Seniors who have had so much post-season success in the past.

Bucknell played terrific basketball.  I'd say they have a very good shot against Wisconsin.  However, Kansas played plain-out awful.  Langford was hurt; he just couldn't do the things he normally does.  Aaron Miles rarely even seemed to try to penetrate.  J.R. Giddens 3-pt shooting disappeared (as it had for most of the second half of the season).  If it weren't for the always-great play of Wayne Simien and the impressive step-it-up performance by Michael Lee, this would have been a blowout.

That said, there were enough really questionable calls that make you wonder about a bias towards producing Cinderallas.
