Check out this great summary of the news on these investigations, with the focus where it out to be, not on the tired old bit about "no WMDs found."  My arguments in favor of liberating Iraq were never predicated on an assumption about WMDs in Iraq, so I'd really like to quit hearing about them: they aren't that important.
