<p>
Just got back from vacation with my in-laws.  Now I'm setting up my new <a href="http://www.tivo.com">Tivo</a> that they gave me for my birthday.  And I find out that <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&id=820&t=1">Firefox 1.0</a> has been released!  So I'll be grabbing that shortly; go grab it yourself.
