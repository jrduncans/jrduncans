<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/12/19/how-to-start-an-argument-on-a-microsoft-mailing-list/">Xbox 360 is a Web 2.0 product</a>.

I love my Xbox 360, but no, it's not Web 2.0.  For as far as this Web 2.0 concept means anything, it's about open methods of sharing: RSS, API's for web applications, etc.  
</p>
<p>
It's cool that I can download things from the Xbox marketplace, but that's the only place I can download from.  Nobody else can put up a marketplace that conforms to some API, that I can now add to my places to download content from.

Same thing goes for the media-center type capabilities.  I'm sure its great if you have an Windows Media Center PC.  But for me, the only good thing I get is if I plug in my iPod.  I can't get anything of value off of my network.  Yes, I know about Windows Media Connect, but, as far as I can tell, it's worthless when your content resides on a third file-sharing device not running Windows.  I'm a technical person, but I haven't figured out how to get it work with either mapped network drives, nor UNC paths to an authenticated network share.

Xbox 360 has a very impressive walled-in community.  Web 2.0 is about communities without those walls.
