Despite the utter wasteland that is this blog, I've decided to start posting to yet another place on the internet: <a href="https://twitter.com/jrduncans">Twitter</a>.  The theory goes that if you're interested in knowing the minutiae of my life, you can follow me on Twitter (or subscribe to my Twitter feed or what have you).  I, knowing that everyone looking at my Twitter posts has implicitly consented to being bombarded with inane details about my day, can safely post such details with the concern of them being "blog-worthy", or even "Facebook-status-worthy".

Now, if only I can do something <em>interesting</em>, I may have a reason to post something to my blog again...
