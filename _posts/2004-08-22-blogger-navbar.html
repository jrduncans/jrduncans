<p>
Blogger is now offering a <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=952">Navbar</a> to be placed at the top of one's blog.  This replaces an advertisement bar on Blogger/Blog*Spot hosted blogs.  For those of us with sites being hosted externally and being published via FTP, it's optional.  Unfortunately, at the moment it's simply a choice at the top, not a tag in a template, so it has to be at the top, and I have to change my design a little to accomodate it.
</p>
<p>
It provides the nice feature of allowing a search of the site (so I can get rid of the one in the navigation section), as well as supporting Blogger, which I've really enjoyed using.  The downside is that it makes my site look less independent, and more like an amatuer-ish hosted site.  It also allows people to visit other recently updated Blogger produced Blogs with a single click.

<p>
Should I put this on my page?  I think I'll at least try putting it on to play around with the issues it may cause.  So expect to see it at least temporarily.
