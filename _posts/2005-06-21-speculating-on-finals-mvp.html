I'm quite hopeful that the San Antonio Spurs will finish off the Pistons tonight, especially since Detroit hasn't won in San Antonio since 1997.  So, now may be my last chance to speculate on the Finals MVP (other than during the game).
</p>
<p>
In my mind, how players played during losses doesn't matter.  So lets examine the top players in each of the Spurs 3 wins so far.  Game 1 MVP: Manu Ginobili.  Great numbers, and most importantly, picked up his game in the 4th quarter.  Tim Duncan's stats were very good as well.  Game 2 MVP; Manu Ginobili.  Even more impressive 4th quarter, and great stats.  Tim Duncan was solid, but not as good as in Game 1.  Game 5 MVP: Robert Horry.  Duncan had better numbers all-around, but played poorly at the end of the game, while Robert Horry gave a legendary clutch performance.  Manu Ginobili's points and percentage were down from games 1 and 2, but he provided 9 assists, including the great pass to Horry for the game winning 3-point shot.

<p>
If either Manu or Duncan take over this game, then whichever one does deserves the MVP.  If Horry somehow turns in another performance like Game 5, then he could even become the most unlikely Finals MVP of all time.  But, if things are fairly balanced, who do you go with, Ginobili or Duncan?  I think it'll come down to just a feeling as to who is more important and consistent in the fourth quarter of the Spurs 4th win.

Now, if the Pistons were to somehow come back and win this series, who's leading them for MVP?  With only half the required wins, it's really too early to speculate, but I'd say Ben Wallace was the most important player in their wwo wins so far.
