[Scoble](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com) asks
[Why don't you use a memetracker?](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/02/08/why-dont-you-use-a-memetracker/). Check out the comments, as I
agree with most of the answers. Summary: not enough new stuff, not a useful format, and, finally, why would I?

What would a useful "Memetracker" look like? First, it will have to integrate with my feed-reader/aggregator (do we have a single agreed
upon name for this yet?) data. That way you can exclude the stuff I already know about. Plus you could tailor it to be interesting to me.
[Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) could pull this off, as could any other aggregator that centrally stores feed-reading data.
Or, if [attention](http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/attentionxml) or some other feed-reading-data-sharing mechanism were available, it
could be done by a third party.

Second, it would be provided primarily as another feed.  Not having to go out to another website and hitting refresh over-and-over is
exactly the reason we love RSS and Atom so much.

So, what I'd want is an Atom feed of new items that I have neither read yet, nor have I read anything that linked to it yet. I want to see a
summary of the main content, and possibly some links to the most interesting commentary on the item. An algorithm to determine
[interestingness](http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/) like [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) does would be the killer feature. A
combination of popularity and making sure it includes some significant commentary instead of just being a another quote-and-link would be a
good starting point. And, of course, I want "interestingness" to be somewhat based on what I already read, so that I can get more Java and
less Microsoft, more economics and constitutional law and less party politics, and soccer and basketball, instead of just technology and
politics.
