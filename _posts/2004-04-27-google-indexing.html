<a href="http://www.google.com">Google's</a> indexing of this site at it's new location has been interesting.  For a while, only the main page was indexed.  Now it seems like only the next level deeper is indexed (you can see the indexed files by searching for '*' in the Google search bar on the side of the page).  Since that gets this blog page indexed, I'm pretty happy.  Hopefully in a couple of weeks Google will index the blog archives and my actual writings.

Speaking of Google, as an active <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger </a>user, I got into the <a href="https://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a> beta.  I don't really have a need for another web-based e-mail address, but it does have some nice features.  Most of the focus of news reports on Gmail have been the 1 GB of storage for free.  But the neat stuff is searchable mail, mentioned frequently in the privacy-complaint news pieces on Gmail :), and categorizable mail (you can label pieces of mail for easier finding, as well as 'star' important e-mails).  To me, though, the <em>really</em> cool feature is the fact that it attempts to display your e-mails grouped as conversations, rather than just a series of individual e-mails.  I find that feature very neat, and hope to see it in traditional e-mail clients for my standard e-mail account.

Beyond that, now that I'm really doing web application programming at work, I find the interface to be pretty interesting.  I'm sure that will get tweaked as time goes by, so I look forward to checking up on it every once in while.  If you want to help me play with it, you can e-mail <a href="mailto:stephen.duncan@gmail.com">stephen.duncan@gmail.com</a>.  (I guess that putting it up here will check it's spam filtering capabilities...)
