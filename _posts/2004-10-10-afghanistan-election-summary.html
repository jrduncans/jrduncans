UPDATE: And here's more from the BBC:

    Observers approve Afghan election

    International observers have endorsed Afghanistan's first presidential election, rejecting opposition calls for a new poll amid reports of fraud. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said demands by 15 of the 18 presidential candidates to annul the poll were "unjustified".

    The local Free and Fair Elections Foundation of Afghanistan (FEFA) said the poll was "fairly democratic".
