Ok.  The Spurs selected Ian Mahinmi with their only draft pick this year.  He is 6'10", so I guess that's why the Spurs picked him over Wayne Simien.  But I think if you're not drafting for that one needed spot at the 3-spot, you should go for the best, proven player, and Simien is definitely that.  The Spurs have been very good at picking foreign players, obviously, so I hope they know more than me.

And, of course, Simien goes at the next pick to the Miami Heat, a likely foe for the Spurs to go against in future NBA Finals.  I hope the Spurs don't come to regret this, as Simien deepens the Heat bench.

Update: R.C. Buford came on the show via tele-conference to explain the pick right before I was about to turn off the television.  They intend for Mahinmi to remain overseas for a few years and develop.  That's certainly seems like it's going to work well with Scola.  The Spurs get to own the rights to the player while he develops, without him affecting the roster.  Maybe this is part of the Spurs plan on maintaining their long-term success.  I need to look into how this works though.  What happens if the Spurs decide they don't ever want to bring him over to the NBA?  What if they're in a situation where they don't have the space for him, but some other team wants the player?
