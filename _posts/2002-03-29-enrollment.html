I'm now enrolled for the Fall semester.  Whoo hoo!  I'm taking Moral Issues in Computer Technology (PHIL 375), Control Systems (EECS 444), Computer Systems Design Lab I (EECS 541), Computer Architecture (EECS 645), and Introduction to Communications Networks (EECS 663), in case you want to plan your schedule around me ;)
