Very happy to see the Spurs step it up and win in the 4th quarter against the Rockets.  I'm just surprised they managed to do it with Tony Parker suddenly deciding he's a jump-shooting point guard.  I don't think he tried to penetrate even once all game.  I can't figure out why, and I have trouble imagining it was by design.
