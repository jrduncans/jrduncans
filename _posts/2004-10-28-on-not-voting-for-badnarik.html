<a href="http://www.janegalt.net/blog/archives/004973.html">"Jane Galt" on why she's not voting for the Libertarian candidate</a>.  She basically says exactly what I said to my wife yesterday afternoon: with the current state of the LP, now is <em>not</em> a good time for the LP to get publicity.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is how he does when he's being interviewed by a libertarian. As Mr Balko says, "Given how close this election is, even if Badnarik does worse than Harry Browne did in 2000, there's a small chance that the LP could draw enough votes in a few states to tilt the outcome one way or the other. Should that happen, both Badnarik and the LP could get more media exposure than the LP's gotten in years. I'm sorry, but I'm just not convinced that either Badnarik or the LP speaking on behalf of libertarianism to a national audience with limited exposure to the ideology would ultimately be good for libertarianism, the philosophy."
