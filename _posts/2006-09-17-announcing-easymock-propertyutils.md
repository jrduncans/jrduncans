I've created a new open-source project: [EasyMock-PropertyUtils](/projects/easymock-propertyutils/index.html){: .internal}.
Basically, this library allows you to use JavaBeans-style property matching for arguments when using [EasyMock](http://easymock.org).
I plan to add some end-user documentation and blog some more about both EasyMock and this project soon. This is being done separately from
EasyMock because it's use of non-refactoring safe strings doesn't fit the philosophy of EasyMock. The project is quite small, and I have no
idea what the interest-level will be, so I'm just hosting it alongside the rest of
[my personal projects](http://code.google.com/p/jrduncans/) on my [Google Code Hosting](http://code.google.com/hosting/) site.
Hopefully there isn't something like this already out there that I missed.
