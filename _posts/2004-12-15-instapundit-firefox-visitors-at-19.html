An impressive example of a non-techy site receiving a very large amount of Firefox visitors.  While there's something to the argument that those who get their political news from a Weblog are likely to be more tech-saavy; I think that the more tech-saavy are reading Instapundit via RSS, which is unlikely to be counted in his stats.  For instance, I read Instapundit using Firefox, but through Bloglines.
