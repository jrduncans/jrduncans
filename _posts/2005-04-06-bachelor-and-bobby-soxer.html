Thanks to <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a> and <a href="http://www.turnerclassicmovies.com/">Turner Classic Movies</a>, I've been able to watch a lot of movies, especially movies from 1940's and '50's.  I figure maybe a lot of people haven't seen these, so I should blog about ones I liked.
</p>
<p>
Tonight my wife and I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039169/">The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer</a>, starring <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000026/">Cary Grant</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000073/">Shirley Temple</a>.  If you're like me, you probably only think of Shirley Temple as the singing-dancing child-star.  In this movie, however, she plays a 17 year-old high school girl, in love with an older man, who's not interested, but has to date her by court-order.  If you can't tell by that plot summation, this is a very silly comedy story.

I bring up my ignorance of this aspect of Shirley Temple's career, because I was surprised at how truly excellent she was in this movie.  Her screen prescense and ability to play the best stereotypical, dramatic, silly high school girl with a crush I've ever seen in a movie.  She really carries the film.  Beyond the movie was a successful and fun light comedy.  I find, at the moment, that a light comedy is really something I enjoy, and very little in current television or movies deliver.  It's all generally over-the-top, or heavy on the "feel-good" emotion or drama.
