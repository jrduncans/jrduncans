I saw a shirt today.  It had a guy in it.  That wasn't unusual.  Happens all the time.  This shirt had something to say.  That, also, was not unusual.  It said its piece the normal way: a phrase printed on its front.  It said: "It's OK Not to Drink."  And I thought, no it's not, you'll die.  From dehydration.

--Yes, this may very well be a sign of things to come.  I feel I should update stuff on my blog more often, no matter how inane the update may be.  Also, although this in no way matches or lives up to Charlie Canola, it definitely reminded me about those stories.  If on the off chance somone responsible for the Charlie Canola stories, especially whoever actually has copies of them, stumbles across this web page, they should contact me about displaying them here on the web.  For those of you who are lost, don't worry about it.  Hopefully I'll get to show you what I meant in the future.
