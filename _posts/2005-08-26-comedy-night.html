Last night Diane and I went out to a comedy club with Jessica Kaizar, a good friend from high school who's been stationed here.  It was an amateur comedian contest, and then some pros trying out some new material and getting warmed up for the weekend, so the quality of the material varied quite a bit.  But it was a lot of fun.
