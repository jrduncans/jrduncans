So, I'm happy to see that, after Google's work on Orkut and Gmail, Blogger has gotten a serious update.  The most noticeable new feature is that it supports comments.  So, I've gone back and made several posts support posts, in case anyone has anything to say.  For now, anonymous comments are allowed.  We'll see if that causes a problem.  Obviously, registered comments are preferred.

I'll be working on modifying my template to support comments.  Let me know what you think about how it looks.

Other than that, you can also e-mail blog entries in, and the interface is much nicer.  Plus some other little odds and ends.  Anyhow, with this update, I'll be sticking with Blogger at least a bit longer.  I'm excited!
