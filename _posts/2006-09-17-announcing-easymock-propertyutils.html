<p>
I've created a new open-source project: <a class="internal" href="/projects/easymock-propertyutils/index.html">EasyMock-PropertyUtils</a>.  Basically, this library allows you to use JavaBeans-style property matching for arguments when using <a href="http://easymock.org">EasyMock</a>.  I plan to add some end-user documentation and blog some more about both EasyMock and this project soon.  This is being done separately from EasyMock because it's use of non-refactoring safe strings doesn't fit the philosophy of EasyMock.  The project is quite small, and I have no idea what the interest-level will be, so I'm just hosting it alongside the rest of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jrduncans/">my personal projects</a> on my <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google Code Hosting</a> site.  Hopefully there isn't something like this already out there that I missed.
