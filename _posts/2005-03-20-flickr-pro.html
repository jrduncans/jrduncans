<p>
I just purchased a Flickr Pro account for two years.  After I started to put in all the pictures I currently have here on the site, and noticing the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help.gne#65">limitations on free accounts</a>, I decided to go ahead and shell out the money.  It's a great product, and I don't mind paying for it at all.  Look for my picture page to have thumbnails pulled from Flickr soon.

Of course, there was also <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2005/03/yahoo_actually_.html">the news today</a>.  On the one hand, "Pro account holders will get super mega bonuses, to be announced soon" sounds really good.  On the other hand, I hope I didn't just waste money, based on "Free accounts will have more storage and uploads --  pro accounts too -- AND they'll be cheaper."  I certainly hope any savings will somehow be passed on to those with existing pro accounts, on a prorated basis.  Especially since I made the decision to purchase now based on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/upgrade/">this page</a> which implies that current prices are for a limited time, and would go up when Flickr moved out of beta.  Of course, I didn't remember the blog post mentioning prices being cheaper when I made the two-year purchase...
