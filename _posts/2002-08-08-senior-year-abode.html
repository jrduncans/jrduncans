As you can tell, I haven't done anything on the webpage this summer.  I've been busy working.  I've got a week left to go.  It's been good.  It pays extremely well, I'm getting good experience for my career, and it's been enjoyable, and most of the time not too difficult.  But it really has been most of my activity.  Haven't played much in the way of video games, although Diane and I have developed a small addiction to The Sims.  Anyhow, I should be leaving Virginia a week from Saturday and therefore end up in Lawrence Sunday night.  The apartment I will be living at for my senior year (with Diane, Jason, and Rorik) is South Pointe apartements:

In case you wanted to know.
