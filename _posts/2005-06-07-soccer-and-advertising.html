As always seesm to happen lately, I meant to blog this a while ago, I've been too busy.  This thought struck me as I watche the U.S. Men's National Soccer team play Costa Rica in a World-Cup qualiying match on Saturday.  But before I get to that, I have say how impressed I was by the play of Kasey Keller.  Several brilliant saves helped ensure the US's win.  I don't know how he's considered and ranked around the world, but from what I see of soccer, he deserves to go down as one of the best international goal-keepers over the span of his career.

On to the topic: television advertising and soccer.  For the longest time, it's been the consensus that soccer was an adversting disadvantage in America because there are no pauses in play for commercial breaks.  On the other hand, though, there's been a lot of talk about the effect of TiVo and other DVR/PVR devices on commercials.  When you can fast-foward or skip commercials, they become completey ineffective.  The logical next step is trying to insert advertising into the game.  Since this is what is already done in soccer matches, soccer may have a head start when it comes to the future of adversting when TiVo and DVR/PVRs become more prevalent.
