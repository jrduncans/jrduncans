<p>
Due to significant decreases in productivity, the United Nations announced today that it was banning April Fool's Day.  They also cited human rights violations, stating that the shame felt by those who were fooled infringed upon the inherent dignity of all human beings.  A follow-up proposal to categorize all practical jokes as torture under the Geneva Convention is still under deliberation.
