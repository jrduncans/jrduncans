<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/gleemie/94676.html">Amusing blog post</a> from a Google employee who was doing laundry at work, when Colin Powell, who was touring the site, came in.  He discussed her laundry techniques, and then she got to explain her job, UI Design to him.  Talk about a unique experience!
