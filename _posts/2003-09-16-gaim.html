<p>
If you don't like AIM's ad windows and such (and find, as I did tonight, that I can't get rid of it with any free program yet), and you, like I, find Trillian to be bloated, unintuitive, and ugly, then get <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net">gaim</a>.  It's available for many OS's, including Windows and Linux.  It's open-source, so it'll continue to be free and improve.  It's not perfect, but I'm liking using it better than the alternatives so far.  I'll update if that opinion changes.
