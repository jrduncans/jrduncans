I decided that I would wait for Windows XP Service Pack 2 to come out over Windows Update, rather than install early.  So, I did it today.  Nothing big to report.  It was rather rude, as it placed Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player shortcuts into my Quick Launch bar.  Bad Microsoft!  I have my quick bar and such set up exactly how I like it, leave it alone!

Beyond that, the ublocking of popup-ads in the new Internet Explorer seems rather buggy/un-intuitive compared to the feature in nightly builds of Firefox.  I'm certainly not impressed with IE.  But it is an improvement for all those who insist on using it, so good for them.
