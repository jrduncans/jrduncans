I don't know how <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com">Tycho and Gabe</a> do it.  I get a video game I'm really into, and I can't possibly find time to write anything in my blog about it.  Keeping people up to date on a regular basis?  Madness...
</p>
<p>
I took a 4-day weekend last weekend (and with Memorial Day, I get a 3-day this weekend...going back to a full schedule is going to be hell).  Diane and I went to blockbuster on Friday to rent some video games.  I saw <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-1847">Pokemon coliseum</a>.  I remembered the fun Diane and I had playing my little brother's copy of Pokemon Stadium on the Nintendo 64 a few summers ago, so I was interested.  But they didn't have it.  I rented Wario Ware Inc. for the Gamecube instead.

But, eventually, I couldn't resist.  I went to Blockbuster again on Sunday.  They still didn't have it.  So, on a whim, I just went out and bought the game.  And played it non-stop for the rest of the weekend, practically.

The addiction has gotten worse.  This weekend, I bought the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/accessoriesgcn#a726ef30-c8ae-48c5-89f0-c687c36fcb8a">Gameboy Player</a>, the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/accessoriesgcn">GAMECUBE Game Boy Advance Cable </a>, and <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-1390">Pokemon Sapphire</a>.  <a href="http://ryangregg.com">Ryan</a>, I'm sorry I ever made fun of you in regards to Pokemon.
