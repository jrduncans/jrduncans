<p>
If you use <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>, you need <a href="http://weblog.philringnalda.com/2005/11/21/no-ask-what-bloglines-can-do-to-you">to read this</a>.  It's a pretty significant security issue.  In addition, it's a sign that Bloglines is unresponsive.  While fixing a security hole is high priority, they also still <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/09/06/Bloglines-Atom-Problem">haven't fixed this</a> either.  That's from September, by the way.  So, I'm in search of a new web-based aggregator.  Any suggestions?

<strong>Update</strong>: Check out the comments.  They're aware of the problem and working on it.  Let's hope this is a sign of increased responsiveness in the future.
