I've recently finished reading all of [Steve Yegge's blog-rants](http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/blog-rants). The overarching theme is
Steve searching for ways to do better at software development. For instance,
[Being the Averagest](http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/being-the-averagest) on why many programmers aren't trying to get better, and
[Practicing Programming](http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/practicing-programming) on how to get better for those who listened and decided
they want to try.  He also chronicles his search for a [better](http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/language-grubbing)
[programming](http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/tour-de-babel) [language](http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/language-trickery-and-ejb).
I suggest reading all of the essays; hopefully they'll inspire you to be a better programmer, and you can take advantage of the work
"Stevey" has done to guide you down the path of improvement. Stevey wrote all these articles while working at Amazon; make sure to also
check out his [current blog](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com) now that he works at Google.
