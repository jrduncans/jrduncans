Nevermind the stats: Robert Horry was the MVP of Game 5.  After four blowouts, we now have a game go to overtime, where Robert Horry makes the game-winning three.  He went 5-6 from three-point range in the game.

After Manu Ginobili's performance in Game 1, Rasheed Wallace said about Manu: "Ain't nothing too special about the kid."  And yet, Rasheed chose to double-team Ginobili and let the hottest player on the floor, Robert Horry, be open for one of his patented game-winning three-point shots.  Hmm...

The San Antonio Spurs now have a two chances to beat the Pistons at home to win another NBA championship.  Go Spurs Go!
