Even more questions: what about skinnable OS's?  What's the windows-look-and-feel for someone who chooses the classic mode view in Windows XP?  Silver vs. Blue theme?  Keramik vs. Plastik on KDE?  KDE or Gnome on Linux?  <br /><br />The best answer, it seems to me, is that there needs to be a standard for the widgets availabe on an OS and ways to access those, so that cross-platform GUI toolkits, be it XUL, GTK, Java, what-have-you can use the underlying widget + OS-level styling to maintain a consistent look-and-feel.  As it stands now, it's way too much up to the application to implement consistency & skinning.<br /><br />Which leads to my biggest beef with cries for fitting in with the OS: I like to improve the look of my XP machine by using programs that look better on it.  I like iTunes.  I like Noia 2.0 Extreme theme for Firefox.  I like a similar brushed-metal theme for Opera if I use it.  Since OS level skinning isn't really up to snuff, it's really nice to have apps that implement their own buttons so you can themes/skins.
