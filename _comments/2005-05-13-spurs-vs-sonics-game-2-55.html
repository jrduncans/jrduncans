So the Sonics shouldn't have given James the ball tonight? Because they didn't want those 15 points he added? <BR/><BR/>You want to talk about bad tactics. What about Ginobili throwing his head back as if he was fouled. He even fell to the floor injured. But on the replay the announcers laughed at him because NO ONE WAS THERE.
