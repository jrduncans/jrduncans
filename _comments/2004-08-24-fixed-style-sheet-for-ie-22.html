The child operator?  Hmm... I had no idea that existed.  I didn't think it was necessary to have any operator between two elements (other than a space) to indicate the parent child relationship with IE.<br /><br />I haven't ever looked into how it was supposed to work, since it seems that it works in IE and Mozilla the same way with just the space.  Is this something different?
