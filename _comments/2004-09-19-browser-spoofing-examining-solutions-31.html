Well, now that I wrote all that out, it seems that's what the idea in #3 was.  That'll teach me to not read through the links you provide as well!<br /><br />Anyways, I think that's a potentially good idea, although I'm not sure if I like how it's replacing the status bar.  I think perhaps it should be added along with the status bar.  The browser status bar could still be used to show additional information that wouldn't fit in the top bar, or wasn't as important to the user.  Also, the status bar gives a larger place to grab the corner of the window for resizing purposes, and I'm always a big fan of larger UI targets.
