I'm not sure I'm happy with any of these solutions.<br /><br />As the web becomes more used for application development with more companies moving traditional native applications over to web-based applications, I think that additional UI elements being forced to be on the screen at all times becomes a huge hassle.<br /><br />For instance, imagine if you have a pop up window where you want to emulate the typical wizard interface.  If the navigation buttons appear on this window, then the user can (and probably will) use them instead of the integrated navigation methods on the page.  This could cause problems with the web application, and confusion on the user side.<br /><br />I don't think Mozilla putting the security information in more that one place is a bad idea.  More places with the information hopefully mean more places people can/will look for this information.  It also makes spoofing harder because you have to make sure you get all your bases covered to pull it off.<br /><br />Perhaps a better solution would be to insert some sort of visible margin around the inside of the browser frame that can't be removed.  Then, there would be an obvious padding of everything that was being spoofed inside the browser window, clearly seperating it from the chrome that makes up the browser.  Of course, web developers have for years enjoyed the ability to make the outside border of the page disappear.<br /><br />However, if this extra space was just used as a margin along the top and bottom of the browser content render section, this would probably not harm web development efforts any, and should still serve the same purpose.  It wouldn't have to be much space, filled with a color or pattern or other decoration that would be clear.  Then, if a window was opened without any browser chrome, but instead rendered chrome inside the browser content section, it would be obvious that menus and other aspects of the typical interface would be appearing below this margin.  I believe this would easily pass all your tests, and should even be somewhat obvious to a regular user of the brwoser as well as a high tech one.<br /><br />I think the ultimate solution to this problem though might be to not rely on any single method, but to use several different solutions.  I like the idea of having the hostname displayed on the status bar, like we see in firefox 1.0PR for SSL sites.  That's a good step, but teaching people to use the information they have is another step that is perhaps the hardest of them all.
