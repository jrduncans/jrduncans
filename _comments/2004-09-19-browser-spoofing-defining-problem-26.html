I think the URL bar is a biggest risk for pishing because it would be easier to make it appear as though you were actually at your bank website (or whatever), and not at some pisher's website.  If it looks like a browser and the URL bar says I'm at mybank.com, I'm probably going to believe it.<br /><br />Worse yet is how it doesn't even have to look exactly like their browser to get someone to be faked out.  Consider how often less computer inclinded people see those old style pop up ads that had a picture of a Windows error box in them, and foolishly clicked on the banner ad thinking it would make the error go away.  Even just looking partially like the same web browser can be enough to trick someone into being comfortable with it.
