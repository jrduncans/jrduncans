Yeah, I'm not really sure how it works either.  It updates at least the post entry page and the index page, but perhaps more.  I'll have to check the FTP server logs sometime and see.<br /><br />I do hate the fact that when you want to post comments it appears to force you to login, and even worse after you login, it still defaults to anonymous.  If I wanted to post anonymously, I probably would have clicked the big button that says "Post as Anonymous" before I logged in!<br /><br />Other than that, it appears to offer everything any other blogging software would, but with a nice Google-backed central database of your posts and comments.
