While true, what I go on to try to say in my last post on the subject is that the address bar still has the problem of putting a bunch of garbage before the real domain name that makes it look like you're on your bank's site, or whatever.  So something that simply strips out the domain name and displays it might be best, although getting user's to look at that instead of the address bar is the hardest part.
