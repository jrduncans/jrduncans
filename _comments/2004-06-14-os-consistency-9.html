I agree with you to some extent.  However, I think that the look aspect is important as well.  Feel is clearly a critical part of developing a good application.  If it doesn't feel like the application belongs on the OS, then most users of that OS won't run it.<br /><br />The look is also imporant.  As more and more operating systems are moving towards an eye candy approach, like Mac OS X and Windows Longhorn, developers are going to need to start making their applications look pretty too.  Otherwise a competiting product that does the same thing but looks pretty will be the winner.  Clearly this means that artists are going to have to become a part of any development shop, which should be interesting.<br /><br />On developing cross platform applications, it becomes a huge pain to try and maintain consistancy and yet fit in with the application.  Java decided to work around this by creating their own look and feel which is different from any OS (at least, this was their inital approach).  It didn't work so hot, and now new UI libs are coming out to take a different approach, using the Windows widgets when running on the Windows OS.  Mozilla has the same problem on the Mac, using Windows style buttons which I often overlook not thinking they are actually buttons when I'm on the mac.<br /><br />Both look and feel are important, as is presenting a consistant user interface.  The application should look the same as any other part of the application.  In addition, it should fit in with the other programs running on the OS, in the way it behaves, the way it looks, and the way it acts.  However, extending in new directions off the way the platform looks and feels can be a good thing, with examples of WMP9 and other applications which still have a similar windows look and feel, but present a UI with different styling.  Now, how do you do that on a cross platform level?<br /><br />Yikes.  I just rambled on a lot.  I hope that makes sense.  If not, I'll have to come back and clear things up.
