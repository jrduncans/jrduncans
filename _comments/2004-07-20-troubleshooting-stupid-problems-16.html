It's not an XML issue.  The $ has no special meaning in XML.  It's just &, <, and > that you really have to watch out for with XML.<br /><br />I couldn't tell you if it was related to Tomcat or Oracle though, although I think Oracle should support $ in the password no problem.  It might be the JDBC driver internally using the $ as some sort of terminator and thus giving you problems.<br /><br />If you ever find out, I'd be curious to know where the problem was with the $.  Undocumented bugs like that are annoying, for sure.
