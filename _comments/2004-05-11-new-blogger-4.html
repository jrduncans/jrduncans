Well, notice the URL of the page with comments.  It's a single URL for a page.  So I believe it ftp's the page that the comment is added to.  Hmm... I guess it might have to do other pages too though... to get the number of comment right...<br /><br />Nevermind.  I have no idea.  I just notice it's much faster than when I add a new post, for whatever reasons...
