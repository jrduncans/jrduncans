Is it really easier to hijack DNS to point to another server than it is to just hack the machine and use its current certificate?<br /><br />Besides, like I said, there's so many bad certificates out there that people just ignore the warnings.  Minimally, if there's a site that you had trusted the certificate on once, and then you go there some day and you get warnings about the certificate, you MIGHT feel suspicious.  But that's only one attack out of several possible.<br /><br />All those need to be addressed, for sure, but I'll keep my focus on assuming DNS is trusted.  Fixing DNS is a whole 'nother can of worms.
