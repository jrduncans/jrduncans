Hi Stephen. I usually dont comment on   <BR/>other peoples blogs but i was a shape high school student too. I was there from 1993 till 1995 and i do remember <BR/>a classmate named jessica kaizar. She signed my yearbook, she liked soccer and she spent way too much time watching power rangers while babysitting her brother. I am gladly <BR/>socked with the possibility of finding an old schoolmate via Internet. I would much appreciate  a response from you or from her !! my e-mail is chrgala25@hotmail.com
