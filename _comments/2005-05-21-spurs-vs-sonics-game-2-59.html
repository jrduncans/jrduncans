Believe what you like.  Ginobili gets beat up as much as any other player in the league.  <BR/><BR/>The refs handed it to us?  What's the basis for that?  <BR/><BR/>If you're looking for reasons that the Sonics big men were in foul trouble constantly, here it is: they don't play defense well, so they fouled a lot.  Getting called for fouls you commit doesn't equate to the refs handing the game to other team.
