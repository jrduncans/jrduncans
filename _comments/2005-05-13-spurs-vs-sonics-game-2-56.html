I'll admit, James getting 15 points makes this post look a bit foolish.  <BR/><BR/>If I recall, the announcers were silent when they finally showed that play with Ginobili from a useful angle.  Why?  Because that angle showed that Antonio Daniels' hand had flown back and hit Ginobili in the face, and they had just spent the previous few minutes making an ass out of themselves by calling it a flop.
