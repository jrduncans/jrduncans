Ok.  I've pretty much already decided it's not worth it.  As it stands, I'd have to change my design a bit too much (though I'd figured out a clever way to have my other banner show up underneath the Navbar, so that on pages other than the main blog page, the banner would replace the Navbar).  <br /><br />Maybe they'll improve it in the future, and I'll change my mind.
