Using just a space is a descendant selector.  So any elements that match the selector (#navigation_section, for instance) that are anywhere under the body would match if I used a space.<br /><br />The > is the child selector.  It only applies to an element directly below it.  So a div with id navigation_section under the body would match, but a div  inside a div that had the id navigation_section would not match.
