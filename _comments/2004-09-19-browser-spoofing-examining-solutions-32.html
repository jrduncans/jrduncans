Hehehe.<br /><br />Yeah, when I first saw that solution, I wasn't convinced at all that it was necessary.  <br /><br />But after slowly walking through the problem, it becomes pretty obvious that Smedberg is right, and that we need something like that.  So obvious that I ended up agreeing with something I started off intending to disprove, and so obvious that your brought it up almost exactly in a comment just before reading the solution.  Almost eerie. :)
