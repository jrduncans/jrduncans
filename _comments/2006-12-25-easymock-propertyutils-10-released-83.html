I'm using it in a web application projet (using Spring, Struts and Hibernate, and JUnit 3.8, StrutsTestCase and LiFT for testing).<br /><br />I wrote a small addition that allows me to test for all properties. The paranoid Blogger doesn't allow me to copy the code here, so contact me to get it if you're interested (my e-mail in on my Blogger profile).
