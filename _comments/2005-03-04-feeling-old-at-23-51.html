Wow.  That makes me feel old too.  Perhaps even more so because I can remember computers that worked where you booted from one disk and worked off the other.<br /><br />Then again, I have to wonder why we still have drive letters at all.  We should move towards a common root file system similar to Linux or Mac OS X.  Then it wouldn't really matter anymore.  Perhaps that concept just isn't clear for users?
