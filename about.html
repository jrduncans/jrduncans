		<p>I was born at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, on November 23, 1981.  I lived both there and at Fort Hood, Texas during my infancy.  I lived in Krottelbach, Germany for pre-school, kindergarten, and 1st grade (Ramstein Elementary).  I attended Pickering Elementary for 2nd grade through 6th grade while living at Fort Polk, Louisiana.  For 7th and 8th grade I went to Patton Junior High at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  9th and 10th were at Killeen High School, while I lived in Harker Heights, Texas.  Finally, for my junior and senior years of high school, I attended <acronym title="Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe">SHAPE</acronym> American High School, at SHAPE, Belgium.</p>
		<p>During those last two years of high school, I played varsity soccer, ran cross-country my senior year, participated in Model UN, and was valedictorian.</p>
		<p>I went to the University of Kansas on a full scholarship for college from 1999 to 2003.  I majored in Computer Engineering, and lived in McCollum Hall for my first two years.  During my freshman year, I met (then) Diane Godfrey, and started dating her.</p>
		<p>I moved from Lawrence, Kansas to Norfolk, Virginia, where my parents live to look for a job.  I married Diane on August 1, 2003. I got a job doing web development and portal administration as a defense contractor, supporting the <acronym title="Standing Joint Forces Headquarters">SJFHQ</acronym> at Norfolk Naval Base, Norfolk, VA, and employed by Northrop-Grumman.  In May 2005, I switched to work doing software development for a portal project and then a web-services security device at Joint Experimentation,<br />
			in Suffolk, VA.  In 2008, I joined <a href="http://www.cormineid.com/">Cormine Intelligent Data</a> to work on a text analytics and mining product.</p>
