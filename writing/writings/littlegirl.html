<div class="poetry-title">Little Girl</div>
<p>
	I see a little girl
	<br/>
	sitting with her parents
	<br/>
	plainly combed hair, and glasses
</p>
<p>
	She eats with her parents
	<br/>
	she tells them about what she's learned
	<br/>
	she is still happy with those wholesome, simple pleasures
</p>
<p>
	And I begin to think:
	<br/>
	This girl will grow up to be good
	<br/>
	she will make her parents proud
</p>
<p>
	But I remember what I have seen
	<br/>
	I remember those around me
	<br/>
	all the people I thought would be good
</p>
<p>
	And I see all the corruption
	<br/>
	I see all the mistakes they will never fix
	<br/>
	I see what has happened to those who were once good little boys and girls
</p>
<p>
	And so I damn them
	<br/>
	for taking away my faith in humankind
	<br/>
	for stealing my hope in a little girl.
