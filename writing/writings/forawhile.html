title: For a While
---
<p>
	The hotel lights turn on in Paris.
	<br/>
	Another person has returned to their room
	<br/>
	After trying on a new life for a while.
</p>
<p>
	It is just window shopping.
	<br/>
	There is no interest to choose to begin anew.
	<br/>
	They just want to rent it for a while.
</p>
<p>
	Although this be a life we'll never lead
	<br/>
	And we'll soon return to our normal days.
	<br/>
	We just want to do something new for a while.
</p>
<p>
	We have chosen the safe, comfortable, easy, meaningless life.
	<br/>
	We have chosen not to face the difficulties that come with a true quest
	<br/>
	But we'll pretend to have one for a while.
</p>
