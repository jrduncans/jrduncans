title: A Bad Night
---
<p>
His body was trembling, his mind was numb,
but he attempted to give off the outward appearance of perfect normality.
It seemed to be working. He munched on some food and half-listened to the
conversation going on around him. And slowly the numbness wore off, as
if his mind and soul were beginning to thaw after a long, awful night in
the cold. . . .

It would have been far better to have stayed
away from her. Loneliness over a distance was much easier to deal with
than this. This awful feeling of being close enough to touch but further
away than he had ever been from all the people he never knew. The sad silence
in the presence of both others' happiness and the one he had always imagined
would be the source of the greatest happiness he could feel, was becoming
unbearable. He used to be able to receive so much joy from just a simple
glance at her, while she sat unaware of the happiness she created. Now
he looked everywhere but at her. Now that simple glance he had once enjoyed
brought him nothing but a feeling of frustration that was of a magnitude
he had never known before. And again the laughter of those ahead of him
jarred in his brain. The unlooked for, unappreciated, and perhaps unwanted
companionship and happiness these other two now had, created by some magician
out of nowhere in notime, was an irony he could not appreciate. Instead,
the unfairness of it all drove him deeper into a self-made gloom. He looked
over at her one more time, tried to speak, but nothing came out. She continued
to walk straight ahead, without ever a single glance towards him. No, this
loneliness of walking right next to her was far, far worse. . . .

The emptiness surrounded him and stabbed at
his soul. He paced and walked and got some water and strolled and jumped
on the bed and rolled over and sat up. And still the silence raged on.
He turned on some music and listened. The rhythm, beat, harmony; the sounds
that had always comforted his mind and held him together through his roughest
moments of bittersweet agony had turned into a disarray of chaotic discord,
screeching at him, tearing at his nerves, attacking his existence. He stared
out the window, and looked down. He nodded his head a few times, banging
it against the window. He walked back and hit the bedpost. His conscious
mind was completely turned off. He could not think. He only knew he wanted
it to stop. The deafening, piercing static that was decaying his mind and
soul in the silent room. He wanted it to stop. The futility of his every
action, every move he made, every move he had ever made. He wanted it to
stop. He wanted it to all go away. It had to stop.

In a last, desperate act, he grabbed at the
door. He walked out of the room and headed towards the elevator, where
he caught up with his friends and they went downstairs together. And slowly
their presence thawed him out. . . .
