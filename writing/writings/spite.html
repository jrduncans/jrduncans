<div class="poetry-title">In Spite of it All</div>
<p>
	You are made up of your misconceptions.
	<br/>
	You want to be different than the last generation.
	<br/>
	But have you examined your rebellion?
</p>
<p>
	This is how it seems to me:
	<br/>
	You take the bad of your parents' generation
	<br/>
	And ignore all the lessons they have learned.
</p>
<p>
	This is how it is:
	<br/>
	You add to these mistakes
	<br/>
	More and sometimes worse mistakes of your own.
</p>
<p>
	Why do you spite the good intentions of others?
	<br/>
	Why do you spite your own intelligence?
	<br/>
	Why do you spite your own future?
</p>
