<div style="text-align: center;">
	<p>
		cold metal, dull from paint
		<br/>
		smooth where painted, and where not
		<br/>
		but roughly combined
		<br/>
		vertical bars up
	</p>
	<p>
		curving away from the sky
		<br/>
		receiver of waste
		<br/>
		they move towards it
		<br/>
		hesitantly they moved there
	</p>
	<p>
		they looked all around
		<br/>
		without care they are
		<br/>
		carelessly tossing it in
		<br/>
		falling to bottom
	</p>
</div>
