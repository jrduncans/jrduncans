<div class="poetry-title">Conversing With a Conservative</div>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Who do you think you are?</p>
<p>Who gave you the right to interfere?</p>
<p>But you're part of it.</p>
<p>It's your fault as much as it is the next man's.</p>
<p>What's wrong with it? Everything!</p>
<p>Why are you arrogant enough to "know" you're right?</p>
<p>Why is what you think better than what I think?</p>
<p>Because there's more of you?</p>
<p>So slavery was right . . .</p>
<p>It's what you said.</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>What's wrong with that? Where's the harm?</p>
<p>But they only hurt themselves. Who do you think you're protecting?</p>
<p>Who are you to say it's worse?</p>
<p>I prefer freedom to prudishness, yes. Why don't you?</p>
<p>No it isn't, ever read the bill of rights?</p>
<p>No, this country was founded on freedom, not imagined values.</p>
<p>Sure, we've messed things up before.</p>
<p>Just because I stutter once, should I then stutter forever?</p>
<p>I think not.</p>
<p>Could you please stop stuttering.</p>
