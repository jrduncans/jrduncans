	"Come on now. Wait a minute."
</p>
<p>
	She kept walking. The young man with short black hair tried again.
</p>
<p>
	"It's not my fault."
</p>
<p>
	"What do you mean it's not your fault?" She turned around. "Who the hell else's fault is it?"
</p>
<p>
	"Well, it's not entirely my fault."
</p>
<p>
	"No, I'm sure you were encouraged." The pretty young lady with reddish-blonde curly hair began to storm down the street again.
</p>
<p>
	"Well, I'm sorry."
</p>
<p>
	"I'm sorry too. I'm sorry I ever met you."
</p>
<p>
	"Aw, don't say that. You can't mean it."
</p>
<p>
	"I do mean it. Goodbye." She suddenly cut across the road.
</p>
<p>
	Traffic began moving again. In just a few moments, she was gone.
</p>
<p>
	"Why the hell did I get so god damn drunk last night?" he asked himself.
