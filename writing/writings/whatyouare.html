title: What You Are
---
<p>
	Pornography, prostitution, homosexuality.
	<br/>What's wrong with you?
	<br/>You're a prude, a puritan.
</p>
<p>
	Marijuana, cocaine, tobacco, alcohol, caffeine.
	<br/>What's wrong with you?
	<br/>You're a hypocrite.
</p>
<p>
	Censorship.
	<br/>What's wrong with you?
	<br/>You're a dictator.
</p>
<p>
	Why?
