<p>
	On a cold day, you'll stand, basking in a patch of sunlight.
	<br/>
	On a hot day, you'll take refuge in the shade.
</p>
<p>
	But you'll play in the snow, and tan on the beach.
	<br/>
	Unless you're from Alaska, or live in Florida.
</p>
<p>
	Are the only ones who are content the ones who never leave their 75 degree homes?
	<br/>
	Do heating and air conditioning make you happy?
	<br/>
	Or do you alternately search for patches of sun and spots of shade?
</p>
