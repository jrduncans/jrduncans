<div class="story-title">If Hemingway Could Not Write</div>
<p style="font: 0.9em; font-style: italic;">
Urnesthemmingweighy is a fly-covered dunghill 87 feet
high (although many claim it is only 85), and it is said to be the place
the cock gets on to crow when it is in love. Its western summit is called
"Po&eacute;zish&ucirc;npayp&egrave;r," the House of Satan. At the summit
there is a dried and dirty can of a beer. No one has explained why someone
was drinking a beer on the dunghill.
</p>
<p>
Ernest Hemingway sat on a bar stool. The stool had a round seat and
was made of wood and had no cushion and was not very comfortable. The legs
were uneven, so the chair rocked. Ernest rocked in the chair a lot. Sometimes
he fell.
</p>
<p>
"Una cerveza."
</p>
<p>
Even though he was in Nebraska and no one spoke Spanish and he had never
been to Spain, he still liked to pretend and order in Spanish or any other
language he knew how to ask for a beer in.
</p>
<p>
"Merci."
</p>
<p>
Or say any other phrase in for that matter. He grabbed the can firmly
with his left hand. He slid his first two fingers on his right hand around
the tab and then slipped them under. With the middle finger he pulled up,
using the first finger for support. He listened and heard the pop of the
tab penetrating the metal barrier. He pulled the tab back and forth until
it broke off. He counted 37. He always counted. He hoped he would count
85, for that was lucky. Once he had counted 87, and that was lucky too,
because that day he had been with Helen.
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
He was sitting outside the store drinking a soda. He couldn't drink
beer in public yet. He had pulled the tab off and counted 87. Helen had
just come out of the store and was leaving to go to the schoolyard. He
liked Helen very much. He liked it the way she walked out of the shop and
looked up from his trashy novel to watch her start down the road. He liked
it about her hair. He liked it about how white her skirt was when she swayed.
He liked it very much that she did not look like a boy. He liked it how
much everybody else liked her but she smiled at him. One day he found that
he liked it the way her chest bounced up and down when she ran. Liking
that made him feel funny. He sat and thought about if he should follow
Helen or go back to the house and steal some beer. He decided to get some
beer. After drinking for a while he decided he would go over to the schoolyard
and watch Helen play indoor baseball. Afterwards he had done things with
her that he liked very much, although he drank too many beers beforehand
to remember it very well. Even though he didn't remember it, he tried to
tell that story later and was told that he shouldn't talk about such things
and that he had a dirty mind. From then on he told that story up to the
point he couldn't remember and said the rest was inaccroachable so that
he wouldn't have to make anything up.
</p>
<p>
"Another beer." He slid his fingers around and under and pulled the
tab. He guzzled it down quickly. He rocked back and forth on the stool.
He fell.
</p>
<p>
"What are you doin' on the floor, you crazy bastard?"
</p>
<p>
Ernest looked up. Ernest stood up. Once Ernest was up he looked again.
Zurito stood awkwardly, watching. It was Zurito. He had a funny name.
</p>
<p>
"Who you callin' crazy?" Ernest asked. He wasn't crazy. He had known
crazy people and he was not crazy. That was crazy to call him crazy. He
wasn't the one who was crazy. He remembered someone who was crazy. Nick
had been crazy.
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
Nick hadn't been crazy at first. He had liked to fish. Sometimes
he fished with his dad. It was when he fished by himself, though, that
he went crazy. Nick went out to the deep part of the pond, in the middle,
without his dad. He went far out, into the deep green water. He kept his
line straight because he could not fish and row the boat at the same time.
It is better to know what you are doing. But Nick would rather be lucky.
It was a hell of a lot easier to be lucky than to do things right, he thought.
Nick felt a tug on his line and he knew exactly what it was. It was a goldfish.
Nick tried to pull it in. He wasn't quite sure how to do this, but he tried
anyway. He tried as hard as he could, but the goldfish did not come up.
This goldfish must be huge, Nick thought. Now alone, out of screaming distance
of his parents, he was fast to the biggest goldfish he had never seen,
and bigger than his nightmares had previously imagined. "I am not a woman,"
he said. "But I will wash ten dishes and wash ten clothes that I should
catch this goldfish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Mother of
My-House if I catch him. That is a promise." Finally Nick figured out how
to use his fishing pole and pulled the goldfish up. He held it in the air
until it was dead. Nick thought it was slimy and smelly, so he did not
put it in the boat. Instead he pulled it alongside the boat. This was a
mistake. As Nick slowly rowed out of the middle of the pond towards the
shore, the first minnow came. It began to nibble on the goldfish. Then
thousands of minnows came. Nick tried valiantly to fight off the minnows,
but there were too many of them and Nick had run out of shoes to throw
at the minnows. By the time Nick got back to shore the goldfish was gone
and only a skeleton was left.
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
Nick went back to his father. His father asked him if he had caught
any fish. Ashamed, Nick quickly said, "Yes, but the minnows ate it." It
was then that the story of Nick's traumatic fishing experience came out.
Nick told his dad about the meat-eating minnows that had eaten all of the
goldfish he caught. His father didn't believe him. "We'll have to go,"
Nick said. "I can see we'll have to go."
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
"All right," said his father. "Let's go there."
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
And so they went back to the pond. They got in the canoe to go out
into the middle of the pond where the meat-eating minnows had been. Nick
had been scared, but in the early morning on the lake sitting in the stern
of the boat with his father rowing, he felt quite sure that he would never
die. He had battled the ferocious minnows, and now he was a Christ-figure.
That was when they first knew Nick was crazy.
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
After that, Nick was especially crazy when they went fishing. Once
Ernest, Bill, and Nick were to go fishing at the swamp. As they were preparing
to leave, Bill selected a sandwich from the lunch basket and walked over
to have look at the rods. Nick and Ernest were trying to pack up the lunch
and close it so that Bill wouldn't eat anymore. They set off towards the
swamp. As they arrived near the edge of the swamp, Nick decided there were
plenty of days coming when he could fish the swamp. He told Bill and Ernest
that he wanted to leave. He told them he had to get back to the Italian
front so that he could take part in the Caporette retreat. He then stole
the lunches and started to run away screaming about Austrians coming after
him. After a while Nick slowed down and walked. He decided that walking
from Michigan to Italy might take a long time. "I'd better get to that
damned bicycle," Nick said to himself. "I don't want to lose the way to
Fornaci."
</p>
<p>
"Are you okay Ernest?" Zurito asked.
</p>
<p>
Ernest had still not registered that the man with the funny name was
in Idaho and had just seen him fall flat on his face. Then he realized
that he should probably answer. "Damn wet floor. The chair slipped."
</p>
<p>
"How's it going here in Maine."
</p>
<p>
"I don't know. Aren't we in Michigan?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm fairly sure we are in Maine."
</p>
<p>
"Well things go the same here as they do in Nebraska. The same as they
do everywhere. I sit at bars and drink." Ernest called for two beers, opened
the can, counted 2 because he was still frustrated from falling on the
floor and had decided to just rip the tab off, and handed a beer to Zurito.
He wasn't sure if Zurito was really his name, but it sounded nice.
</p>
<p>
"Don't you go about with the women anymore?"
</p>
<p>
In the bar the women were always there, but we did not go to them anymore.
We had given up hitting on them a long time ago, Ernest thought. They don't
seem to like us. He said, "Nah, they're all <span style="font-style:italic;">putas</span> anyway. They are
not worth using. Let us utilize another beer."
</p>
<p>
"Do you not care for anything but your drinking? What about love, happiness,
God, success? Do they mean nothing to you?"
</p>
<p>
Abstract words such as love, happiness, God, or success were obscene
beside concrete names of beers, the number of drinks, the names of bars,
the number of women and the time of day, thought Ernest.
</p>
<p>
"No."
</p>
<p>
"Is there something wrong with you? Do you feel okay?"
</p>
<p>
"I feel fine," he said. "There's nothing wrong with me. I feel fine."
What's the matter? Is not drinking in bar as honorable an activity as any
other? Take the bartender for example. The bartender had the old thing,
the holding of his purity of line through minimum of effort, while he dominated
the bottle by making it realize he was undefeatable, while he prepared
it for the opening. Just because Ernest liked the cans better meant nothing.
There was indeed honor in it, and a great talent too. Do you believe the
great DiMaggio would stay and drink as long as I will stay and drink? he
thought. I am sure he would and more since he is young and strong. But
few others can outlast me, thought Ernest. He was very proud.
</p>
<p>
"Excuse me," she said, "the padrone asked me to bring this for the Signora."
</p>
<p>
"Can you not see that this is no Signora. He is George." The waitress
was not very smart and Ernest had now realized that Zurito was an awfully
funny name, and that George was much better.
</p>
<p>
"Well," said George, "you better not think about it."
</p>
<p>
"No. I will not think. I will drink."
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
But he could not help but think. He remembered who Zurito was. He
was the poor boy who had fallen in love with the large Polish nurse in
Spain when he had fallen off his bicycle and broken his tailbone. He had
been very sad, but, with his Polish woman, he was going back to America
and he was very certain about marriage and knew it would fix up everything.
The Polish woman was very happy because she was going to America and was
very certain that stealing all of Zurito's belongings would fix up everything
and she could go to Chicago. A short time after he contracted gonorrhea
from sales girl in a loop department store while riding in a taxicab through
Lincoln Park. This was very difficult to do, but Zurito did it. His condition
quickly worsened and I visited him in the hospital. He was in a hospital
bed and the nurse was not large or Polish. He curled up under the blanket
and went to sleep. He did not wake up. He had not even had time to be disappointed
in the Garbo picture which had disappointed Madrid for a week. It was funny.
Seems like when they get started they don't leave a guy nothing. It was
depressing in the hospital, so after a while I went out and left the hospital
and walked back to the hotel in the rain. That was why it must be George.
</p>
<p>
"Well I got to go," said Tom.
</p>
<p>
"Where ya' goin'?"
</p>
<p>
"The other way from you," Tom told him.
</p>
<p>
That seemed to handle it. That was it. See a man with one name. Give
him another. Now go and forget what it was in the first place. And give
him a different name. That was it all right. Ernest got another beer. He
couldn't understand why Wemedge had left. He guessed it was because the
bar charges everyone and afterward many can still afford to buy another
beer. But those that will not pay it kicks out. Ernest always had people
to borrow money from. It was a good thing to have in reserve. He was starting
to think like an old man worrying about the future instead of . . . other
things.
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
He had known old men. He had known one old man in particular, but
he could become plural if necessary. The old man was not very lucky. The
old man was a doctor who liked to hunt and who had an annoying, nagging
Christian-Scientist for a wife. The old man was Ernest's father. He could
have been lucky, but Ernest decided to drink instead. The old man was lucky
that he had killed himself before Ernest's mother had decided to dress
the old man and Ernest both up like a girl, the way she had with Ernest
when he was younger. That and the fact that cats know how to look after
themselves was all the good luck the old man would ever have. It was important
that the cats look after themselves, or they might get neutered by the
barbaric women of the Hemingway household. Ernest never could admit that
his father had killed himself; if he had, Ernest might have decided to
kill himself as well. Instead of believing he was dead, Ernest liked to
believe that the old man was dreaming about the lions. This was an inside
joke referring to the cats, who, Ernest hoped, had not yet been neutered
by his mother.
</p>
<p>
Ernest saw the major in the corner. Ernest wanted to show him the latest
dirty pictures he had received. He thought this might cheer the major up.
The photographs did not make much difference to the major because he only
looked out the window.
</p>
<p>
It was quickly becoming the time that the bar must close at. Ernest
did not like this. He needed more entertainment for the night. It is a
pain to try to stay amused while everyone else sleeps. It's no big deal,
thought Ernest. After all, he said to himself, it is probably only insomnia.
Many must have it. But he knew better. Very few people had it, at least
none that were fun that lived in Iowa. Ernest walked out into the woods.
A cold mist was coming up through the woods from the bay. He walked along
a train track. He saw a fire.
</p>
<p>
Looking back from the mountain grade before the track curved into the
hills he could see the firelight in the clearing. He walked towards it.
There was a girl there. He fell in love on the spot. He knew he would not
sleep. He tried to hit on her.
</p>
<p>
"Go away." He tried some more.
</p>
<p>
"Quit it." He continued.
</p>
<p>
"Would you please please please please stop."
</p>
<p>
"Please is much better. Now I'll stop. As long as you . . ."
</p>
<p>
She hit him over the head with a frying pan. She thought she had killed
him. He was breathing, but she did not hear him for the beating of her
heart. Ernest felt severe pain in his head and he could feel his heart
beating against the pine needle floor of the forest. She had broken his
heart, as well as his head. He wished he could only feel his heart beating,
but he felt his head much more. It hurt. After listening to caterpillars
eat grass for a while, he finally fell asleep.
</p>
<p>
He woke up. The sun rose. In the morning there was a big wind blowing
and the waves were running high up on the beach and he was awake a long
time before he remembered that his heart was broken. Muck you, you unprintable
obscenity, he thought. Well that was another story he could tell. He would
never tell it though. He would forget. I really should write them down,
he thought. But he never managed to write. His ideas all came when he was
in a bar. People in bars rarely had pencils. And when they did, the pencil
did not seem to write in English when he tried to use it. His life never
seemed to mean much, and he knew he would leave nothing behind except empty
beer cans in strange places.
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
If only he had gone to Paris maybe. If only he drank coffee in caf&eacute;s
in the morning instead of drinking beer in bars at night maybe. Maybe if
he had gone back, begun again, and concentrated. Maybe then he would have
written all those stories he knew. But he didn't. Ernest Hemingway never
wrote a <span style="font-style: none; font-weight: bold;">----</span> thing.
</p>
<p>
"Isn't it pretty to think so."
</p>
