<p>
Good evening, Dr. Reys-kamp, Dr. Robinson, Dr. Ferg-Carter, Monsieur Laurent,
Dr. Johnson, honored guests, faculty members, parents, and fellow classmates,
</p>
<p>
As we take this major step in our lives,
we must all ask the question, "What do I want to do now?" My answer is
"I want to become successful." I think all of us want to be successful,
though. The real question, then, is "What is success?" After searching
for an answer myself, I would like to offer one person's view of the definition
of success.
</p>
<p>
"Success" by Ralph Waldo Emerson
</p>
<p>
	To laugh often and much;
	<br/>
	To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
	<br/>
	To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends;
	<br/>
	To appreciate beauty;
	<br/>
	To find the best in others;
	<br/>
	To leave the world a bit better,
	<br/>
	Whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition;
	<br/>
	To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived
	<br/>
	This is to have succeeded.
</p>
<p>
I think Mr. Emerson pretty much had
it all figured out. He addresses everything we need to know to be successful.
We can learn from each of the parts of his definition and use them to guide
our lives. With this guidance, we can strive to live a complete and satisfying
life.
</p>
<p>
"To laugh often, and much." From where we sit, this may seem to be the easiest part of being successful, but as
life's problems confront us, the first thing we forget to do is to enjoy
ourselves. People tend to worry constantly: even when times are good, the
first thing we think to do is complain or anticipate trouble, rather than
enjoying the moment with a laugh as we should. Life will not be easy all
of the time. We will all have hard times. It is important, though, that
we bounce back from them. Don't worry too much about life; enjoy it. For
those of us graduating tonight, having fun isn't a problem yet. We're still
pretty good at it. However, if we worry too much, and don't take the time
to have fun, we may miss one of the easiest and most enjoyable parts of
success. Finding the humor in life, and laughing, and enjoying it, will
allow us to be happier and more successful people.
</p>
<p>
"To win the respect of intelligent
people and the affection of children." The important thing here is not
in having the respect and affection, but in the actions and characteristics
we must have to win that affection and respect. We can earn the respect
of intelligent people by working hard, making good decisions, being considerate
of others, and by always striving to do the right thing. And, as admirable
as these characteristics may be, Emerson was wise enough to see that true
success requires something even greater than these. High achievers and
workaholics often are able to win respect, but winning the affection of
children takes a more well rounded person: one who is friendly, kind, and
loving. Children cannot be impressed by our accomplishments -- they see
what is in our hearts, in our character. They see the most important aspects
of a good person. If they see the quality of our character, we truly have
what it takes to be a success.
</p>
<p>"To earn the appreciation of honest
critics and endure the betrayal of false friends." While earning the appreciation
of honest critics is very similar to winning the respect of intelligent
people, enduring the betrayal of false friends is a much more difficult
problem. We must all endure the hardships of life to be successful. Enduring
the betrayal of false friends may be one of the most difficult hardships
imaginable. It is unfortunate, but we will all likely have to deal with
this in our lives, and it will not be easy. But, if we overcome this, we
can survive almost any other challenge, and success will be ours.
</p>
<p>
"To appreciate beauty." If we live
all our lives missing the beauty that is around us, no matter what our
apparent accomplishments, we will not have had a truly full life. It isn't
that it is hard for each of us to appreciate beauty; the problem is finding
the time. I would remind everyone that we must make that time and recognize
the beauty around us in whatever environment we find ourselves: in nature,
in people, in art. But beyond merely appreciating beauty, it is also our
duty to preserve the beauty we already have, and encourage the creation
of beauty whenever we can.
</p>
<p>
"To find the best in others." Just
as for beauty, it is not enough to merely find the best in others; we must
seek to bring it out in them. Once we have found the best in someone, we
should encourage that part of them to grow. The easiest way to make the
world a better place is for each of us to do our part to help make those
around us better.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of making the world a better
place, we come now to the last point:
</p>
<p>
"To leave the world a bit better, Whether
by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To
know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived." Making
the world "a bit better" is clearly one of the loftiest goals of a human
life. Many of us, however, seem to think that achieving this is beyond
our means, and that our lives have little or no positive effects. Emerson
gives us many examples, ranging from the personal and common, to more broad
and unique effects our life could have on the future world. We aren't,
of course, limited to those suggested. There is an almost infinite amount
of opportunities to help improve the world. The basic idea is summed up
wonderfully by Emerson: "To know even one life has breathed easier because
you have lived. This is to have succeeded."
</p>
<p>
As we graduate tonight, and take another
big step forward on the road of life, we try to look into the future to
see what we are going to become, what we are going to make of ourselves.
We want success, but as it turns out, success is not a single thing to
be achieved. It is a combination of our happiness, our work, our determination,
and our lasting imprint on the world.
</p>
<p>
To laugh often and much; To win the
respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the
appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends;
To appreciate beauty; To find the best in others; To leave the world a
bit better, Whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social
condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived;
This is to have succeeded.
