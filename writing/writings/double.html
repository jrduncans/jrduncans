<p>
	There was love in the air
	<br/>
	it made you choke, cough, sputter
	<br/>
	It clouded your mind
	<br/>
	it distracted your senses
	<br/>
	There was love in the air
	<br/>
	it made you blind
	<br/>
	It took over your mind
	<br/>
	it made you sad
</p>
<p>
	There was love in the air
	<br/>
	it provided a sweet aroma
	<br/>
	It entered your mind
	<br/>
	it heightened your senses
	<br/>
	There was love in the air
	<br/>
	it was beautiful
	<br/>
	It cleared your mind
	<br/>
	it made you happy
</p>
