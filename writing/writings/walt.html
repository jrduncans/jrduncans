	Object: to finish with the least amount of points.
</p>
<p>
	Deck: 54 cards (2 jokers)
</p>
<p>
	Deal 4 cards to each player.  The rest of the cards are set aside for a draw pile.
</p>
<p>
	Player on dealer's left starts.  Play continues clockwise.
</p>
<p>
	On a player's turn:
</p>
<p>
	1) he plays down 1 card
</p>
<p>
	2) he draws
</p>
<p>
	3) total value of all cards is added together with:
</p>
<p>
	a) numbered cards having a value equal to the number shown on the card
</p>
<p>
	b) face cards having a value of 10
</p>
<p>
	c) an Ace having either a value of 1 or 11
</p>
<p>
	4) if the value of the cards added together is less than 21, play continues clockwise.
</p>
<p>
	5) if the value of the cards added together is more than 21, 
	the player takes these cards and lays them face up, in his point pile, and kept separate for each time this occurs.
</p>
<p>
	6) if the value of the cards added together is equal to 21, the player takes these cards and lays them face down in his clear pile.
</p>
<p>
	--once the draw pile is empty, skip step 2)
</p>
<p>
	Play continues until no cards remain in anyone's hand.
</p>
<p>
	Points are calculated in the following manner:
</p>
<p>
	a) for each set in the point pile, the value of the set minus 21 equals the number of points
	given; this is done for each set and the points are added together
</p>
<p>
	b) for each card in the clear pile one point is subtracted from the total given by a)
	You may continue to play with the deal being passed to the player on the left of the previous dealer.
	Points are maintained and added each round.  A maximum number of  points may be set to limit the number of rounds played.
