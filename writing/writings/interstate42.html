<p>
	I sit, pulled over on the side of the road
	<br/>
	with map out, and my path highlighted.
</p>
<p>
	The masses of headless motors pass me by,
	<br/>
	as I prepare to join them in traveling onward.
</p>
<p>
	I stop and check my map often,
	<br/>
	for I do not wish to become lost.
</p>
<p>
	And so I head off, towards the horizon:
	<br/>
	an enchanting, anxious, eternal horizon.
</p>
<p>
	I pull off to the side of the road again,
	<br/>
	and I put away my map, and open the door.
</p>
<p>
	I look at the clouds, and study them, and imagine;
	<br/>
	I walk among the wildflowers, and look and smell.
</p>
<p>
	I get back in the car, and close my door.
	<br/>
	As I continue to drive I think:
</p>
<p>
	What do I know of my destination?
	<br/>
	What will I do when I get there?
</p>
<p>
	It is so much easier to take an exit,
	<br/>
	following the signs to something clear.
</p>
<p>
	They're only brief excursions, temporary stops.
	<br/>
	Only a bit a fun before I do some serious driving.
</p>
<p>
	In the end I'll reach my destination,
	<br/>
	if I follow the highlighted path.
</p>
Right?
