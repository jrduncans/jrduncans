<div class="poetry-title">My Escape</div>
<p>
	I stare at an arrangement of pixels.
	<br/>
	I listen to a series of numbers.
	<br/>
	I interact through a row of labeled buttons.
</p>
<p>
	I can live in this synthetic world.
	<br/>
	I don't need the real one.
	<br/>
	This one works just fine.
</p>
<p>The real world's too much.
	<br/>
	I know this one.
	<br/>
	I can control this one.
</p>
<p>Sure, we need the real world.
	<br/>
	But they'll need me in this one too.
	<br/>
	And that's good enough, right?
</p>
<p>
	I don't have any bullshit responsibilities to anyone.
	<br/>
	I don't have to care about anyone else.
	<br/>
	I don't have any reason to give up anything.
</p>
<p>
	Right?
</p>
