<p>
	On a deep-brown sea floats red, pink, white and green.
	<br/>
	And within there are a few daring, yellow, purple.
</p>
<p>
	Around this garden, the people walk.
	<br/>
	Rushing off to soak up knowledge, become enlightened.
</p>
<p>
	Here lies the hope, the future.
</p>
<p>
	But there are cigarette butts in the garden.
	<br/>The smoke and the stench pervade.
</p>
<p>
	And the people's minds are clouded with it: with complaints, and with desires for chemical alteration.
	<br/>
	They wearily tread through each day; caring not for the truth, but only for a way to escape it.
</p>
<p>
	They do not see the garden; they only throw their cigarette butts in it.
</p>
