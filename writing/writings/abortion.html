<div class="other-title">Abortion Argument</div>
<p>
I posted a response to the following in the guestbook on

<h2>Abortion Dilemma's (sic)</h2>
<p>
Would you consider abortion in the following 4 situations?
</p>
<p>
1. There's a preacher and wife who are very, very, poor.
They already have 14 kids. Now she finds out she's pregnant with her 15th.They're
living in tremendous poverty. Considering their poverty and the excessive
world population, would you consider recommending she get an abortion?
</p>
<p>
2. The father is sick with sniffles, the mother has TB.
They have 4 children. 1st is blind, 2nd is dead, 3rd is deaf, 4th has TB.
She finds she's pregnant again. Given the extreme situation, would you
consider recommending abortion?
</p>
<p>
3. A white man raped a 13 year old black girl and she
got pregnant. If you were her parents, would you consider recommending
abortion?
</p>
<p>
4. A teenage girl is pregnant. She's not married. Her
fiance is not the father of the baby, and he's very upset. Would you consider
recommending abortion?
</p>

In the first case, you have just killed John Wesley. One
of the great evangelists in the 19th century.
</p>
<p>
In the second case, you have killed Beethoven.
</p>
<p>
In the third case, you have killed Ethel Waters, the great
black gospel singer.
</p>
<p>
If you said yes to the fourth case, you have just declared
the murder of Jesus Christ !!

It was deleted along with several other entries, and the section "Lammers" apparently explains this . . .
</p>
<p>
The following was my entry in the guestbook:
</p>
<p>
About your abortion test . . .
</p>
<p>
I don't know what most people
think, but I have the feeling that my reaction was probably opposite to
the one you intended . . .
</p>
<p>
"In the first case, you have
just killed John Wesley. One of the great evangelists in the 19th century."
</p>
<p>
I say we could definitely
have done without one more evangelist. People who convince others to believe
in the insanity of Christianity are absolutely evil.
</p>
<p>
"In the second case, you have
killed Beethoven."
</p>
<p>
That would have been a mercy
killing. The man was deaf and went insane. He made the life of his nephew
and sister-in-law a living hell. He stole the boy and abused him (basically).
It would be selfish to prefer him to have lived.
</p>
<p>
"In the third case, you have
killed Ethel Waters, the great black gospel singer."
</p>
<p>
While I have never heard of
Ethel Waters, I do wonder if his life was worth the effects his birth probably
had on his poor mother.
</p>
<p>
"If you said yes to the fourth
case, you have just declared the murder of Jesus Christ !!"
</p>
<p>
This last one is purely fiction
of course. This case never existed. If someone could conceivably fit into
the historical position of Jesus, his ancestry would still be completely
unknown. At a minimum, his life has caused the pointless deaths of innumerable
persons. The Crusades, the Holocaust (Jews wouldn't be persecuted if Christians
didn't exist), the Ku Klux Klan, witches, and all other heretics (for instance
the Inquisition . . .)

<p>
Thank you for convincing me
further in my support of abortion. I have decided to change my stance from
pro-choice to pro-abortion.
</p>
<p>
Once again, thank you.
