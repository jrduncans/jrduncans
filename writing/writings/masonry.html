<p>
	brick on brick on brick
	<br/>
	The Wall is built higher and higher
	<br/>
	there can be no outward expansion
	<br/>
	The Wall encloses the Builder
</p>
<p>
	The Wall is built to keep out danger
	<br/>
	nothing can get him here
	<br/>
	but malediction and benediction are kept out equally
	<br/>
	The Wall blocks all
</p>
<p>
	for fear of the danger, The Wall remains
	<br/>
	no courage exists inside to tear it down
	<br/>
	so it continues to be built
	<br/>
	brick on brick on brick
</p>
<p>
	nothing escapes, nothing penetrates: The Wall
	<br/>
	the Builder dreams of what is beyond The Wall
	<br/>
	but it's too much, to tear down his life's work
	<br/>
	the inside must suffice
</p>
<p>
	the Builder cannot escape The Wall
	<br/>
	he is forever stuck, he has but one hope:
	<br/>
	that his soul and sanity leave before
	<br/>
	The Wall grows too high, brick on brick on brick
</p>
